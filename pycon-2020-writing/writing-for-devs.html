<li>Been trying to post regularly on my blog</li>
<li>Or just make time to write regularly and see how it helps me out</li>

<h3 id="orge4fd0ec">Clarify your thinking</h3>
<blockquote >
<p>
Beginning to ask a question actually helps me debug my problem myself,
especially while trying to formulate a coherent and detailed enough question
body in order to get decent answers. Has this happened to anybody else before?
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Rubber ducking</li>
<li>Stack overflow questions</li>
<li>Asking questions to colleagues - you send a message, that you answer
yourself&#x2026;</li>
<li>So, writing forces you think more carefully, and helps you clarify your thinking</li>

<p>
Writing is thinking on paper &#x2013; On Writing Well, William Zinsser

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Reduce mental load and free yourself up to make connections</li>

<li>Slow yourself down, and consider thoughts fully</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>You can hold only so many things in your head&#x2026; your brain can focus on other
things, than trying to hold onto things - like make connections</li>
<li>Stops you from going around in circles</li>
<li>Writing and thinking go hand in hand. As your write, you think more clearly,
and as you think more, your writing is clarified.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Well actually, thinking is hard</li>
<li>Writing is already hard, you don't have to make it harder for yourself</li>
<li>Additional friction to get started with the process, is not helpful!</li>
<li>If it takes you 10 steps to start writing a new post, you are going to avoid
writing that blog post!</li>
<li>Use simple tools - I use hugo for my blog and I like it.</li>
<li>Automate creating a new post, publishing workflow, etc, if you can</li>
<li>I have found that it has helped me on a few occasions</li>

<ul>
<li>If you think it will benefit more than one person, put it in an internal blog,
