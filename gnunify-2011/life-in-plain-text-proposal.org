#+TITLE: Emacs Org Mode: Life in Plain Text

[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] is a tool for organizing nearly everything in your life.  It
is a major mode in the Emacs editor. 

Org-mode can be used for outlining, note-taking, keeping TODO lists,
clocking work, documentation and publishing and literate programming.
All this using, plain text files!  At it's heart it's an outliner and
very simple, but it is extremely customizable and can be customized to
do almost anything you want. 

This talk will be a tour of some of the functionality of Org-mode,
from the whole array of things that it can do.  I will be covering,
the following topics. 

- Outlining
- Org tables
- Publishing
- TODO lists, Agenda, Scheduling, Clocking
- Capturing tasks
- Literate Programming
