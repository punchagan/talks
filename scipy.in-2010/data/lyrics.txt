Like A Rolling Stone -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Once upon a time you dressed so fine

You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?

People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"

You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about

Everybody that was hangin' out

Now you don't talk so loud

Now you don't seem so proud

About having to be scrounging for your next meal.



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be without a home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?



You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely

But you know you only used to get juiced in it

And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street

And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize

He's not selling any alibis

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes

And ask him do you want to make a deal?



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?



You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns

When they all come down and did tricks for you

You never understood that it ain't no good

You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat

Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat

Ain't it hard when you discover that

He really wasn't where it's at

After he took from you everything he could steal.



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?



Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people

They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made

Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things

But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse

When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose

You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?

Satisfaction -- Rolling Stones
****************************************



I can't get no satisfaction,

I can't get no satisfaction.

'cause I try and I try and I try and I try.

I can't get no, I can't get no.



When I'm drivin' in my car

And that man comes on the radio

And he's tellin' me more and more

About some useless information

Supposed to fire my imagination.

I can't get no, oh no no no.

Hey hey hey, that's what I say.



I can't get no satisfaction,

I can't get no satisfaction.

'cause I try and I try and I try and I try.

I can't get no, I can't get no.



When I'm watchin' my tv

And that man comes on to tell me

How white my shirts can be.

Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke

The same cigarrettes as me.

I can't get no, oh no no no.

Hey hey hey, that's what I say.



I can't get no satisfaction,

I can't get no girl with action.

'cause I try and I try and I try and I try.

I can't get no, I can't get no.



When I'm ridin' round the world

And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that

And I'm tryin' to make some girl

Who tells me baby better come back later next week

'cause you see I'm on a losing streak.

I can't get no, oh no no no.

Hey hey hey, that's what I say.



I can't get no, I can't get no,

I can't get no satisfaction,

No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

Imagine -- John Lennon
****************************************



Imagine there's no Heaven 
It's easy if you try 
No hell below us 
Above us only sky 
Imagine all the people 
Living for today 

Imagine there's no countries 
It isn't hard to do 
Nothing to kill or die for 
And no religion too 
Imagine all the people 
Living life in peace 

You may say I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will be as one 

Imagine no possessions 
I wonder if you can 
No need for greed or hunger 
A brotherhood of man 
Imagine all the people 
Sharing all the world 

You may say I'm 
a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll      join us
And the world will live as one

Johnny B. Goode -- Chuck Berry
****************************************



Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans,Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...He never ever learned to read or write so well,But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.(Chorus)Go GoGo Johnny GoGo GoJohnny B. GoodeHe use to carry his guitar in a gunny sackAnd sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made.People passing by would stop and sayOh my that little country boy could play(Chorus)His mother told him someday you would be a man,And you would be the leader of a big old band.Many people coming from miles aroundTo hear you play your music when the sun go down Maybe someday your name will be in lights "Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!"(Chorus)

Hey jude, don't make it bad. 
Take a sad song and make it better. 
Remember to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 
 
Hey jude, don't be afraid. 
You were made to go out and get her. 
The minute you let her under your skin, 
Then you begin to make it better. 
 
And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. 
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool 
By making his world a little colder. 
 
Hey jude, don't let me down. 
You have found her, now go and get her. 
Remember to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 
 
So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin, 
You're waiting for someone to perform with. 
And don't you know that it's just you, hey jude, you'll do, 
The movement you need is on your shoulder. 
 
Hey jude, don't make it bad. 
Take a sad song and make it better. 
Remember to let her under your skin, 
Then you'll begin to make it 
Better better better better better better, oh.

I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky 
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

I go to the movie and I go downtown somebody keep telling me don't hang around  
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees 

Ohhhhhhhhh.....

There been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

How many roads must a man walk down

Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail

Before they're forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
 
How many times must a man look up 
Before he can see the sky?  
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have 
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows 
That too many people have died?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
 
How many years can a mountain exist 
Before it's washed to the sea?  
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist 
Before they're allowed to be free?

Pretending he just doesn't see?

London Calling -- Clash
****************************************



London calling to the faraway towns
Now that war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Except for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running but I have no fear
Cos London is drowning and I live by the water
London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it brother, you can got it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holding out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no highs
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error but I have no fear
Cos London is drowning and I live by the river
Now get this
London calling, yes I was there too
An' you know what they said - well some of it was true!
London calling at the top of the dial
An' after all this, won't you give me a smile?
I never felt so much a' like...

Maybellene -- Chuck Berry
****************************************



Maybellene, why can't you be true? 

Oh maybellene, why can't you be true? 

You've started back doing the things you used to do.



As I was motivatin' over the hill

I saw maybellene in a coup de ville.

A cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,

Nothin' will outrun my v8 ford.

The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,

She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side.



Maybellene, why can't you be true? 

Oh maybellene, why can't you be true? 

You've started back doing the things you used to do.



Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,

It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.

First thing I saw that cadillac grille

Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.

Offhill curve, a downhill strecth,

Me and that cadillac neck by neck.



Maybellene, why can't you be true? 

Oh maybellene, why can't you be true? 

You've started back doing the things you used to do.



The cadillac pulled up ahead of the ford,

The ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.

It then got clody and it started to rain,

I tooted my horn for a passin' lead

The rain water blowin' all under my hood,

I knew that was doin' my motor good.



Maybellene, why can't you be true? 

Oh maybellene, why can't you be true? 

You've started back doing the things you used to do.



The motor cooled down, the heat went down

And that's when I heard that highway sound.

The cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead

A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.

The cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still

And I caught maybellene at the top of the hill.



Maybellene, why can't you be true? 

Oh maybellene, why can't you be true? 

You've started back doing the things you used to do.

When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,

And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me, 

speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. 

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 



And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree, 

there will be an answer, let it be. 

For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see, 

there will be an answer. let it be. 



Let it be, let it be, ..... 



And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me, 

shine until tomorrow, let it be. 

I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me, 

speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 



Let it be, let it be, .....

Born To Run -- Bruce Springsteen
****************************************



In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected 
and steppin' out over the line 
Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
and strap your hands across my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Will you walk with me out on the wire 
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta find out how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
but there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we'll live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Someday girl I don't know when 
we're gonna get to that place 
Where we really want to go 
and we'll walk in the sun 
But till then tramps like us 
baby we were born to run

In My Life -- Beatles
****************************************



There are places I remember 

All my life, though some have changed 

Some forever not for better 

Some have gone and some remain 

All these places had their moments 

With lovers and friends 

I still can recall 

Some are dead and some are living 

In my life I've loved them all 



But of all these friends and lovers 

there is no one compares with you 

And these memories lose their meaning 

When I think of love as something new 

Though I know I'll never lose affection 

For people and things that went before 

I know I'll often stop and think about them 

In my life I love you more 



Though I know I'll never lose affection 

For people and things that went before 

I know I'll often stop and think about them 

In my life I love you more 

In my life I love you more

People Get Ready -- The Impressions
****************************************



People get ready, there's a train comin'

You don't need no baggage, you just get on board

All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'

You don't need no ticket you just thank the lord

People get ready, there's a train to Jordan

Picking up passengers from coast to coast

Faith is the key, open the doors and board them

There's hope for all among who love the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner whom would hurt all mankind

Just to save his own

Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner

For there is no hiding place against the kingdoms throne

People get ready there's a train a-comin'

You don't need no baggage, just get on board

All you need is faith to hear the diesel hummin'

You don't need no ticket, just thank the lord.

I may not always love you 

But long as there are stars above you 

You never need to doubt it 

I'll make you so sure about it 

God only knows what I'd be without you 



If you should ever leave me 

Though life would still go on, believe me 

The world could show nothing to me 

So what good would livin' do me 

God only knows what I'd be without you 



God only knows what I'd be without you

A Day In The Life -- Beatles
****************************************



I read the news today oh, boy 

About a lucky man who made the grade 

And though the news was rather sad 

Well, I just had to laugh 

I saw the photograph 

He blew his mind out in a car 

He didn't notice that the lights had changed 

A crowd of people stood and stared 

They'd seen his face before 

Nobody was really sure 

if he was from the House of Lords 



I saw a film today oh, boy 

The English army had just won the war 

A crowd of people turned away 

But I just had to look 

Having read the book 

I love to turn you on. 





Woke up, got out of bed 

dragged a comb across my head 

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup 

and looking up, I noticed I was late 

Found my coat and grabbed my hat 

Made the bus in seconds flat 

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke 

Somebody spoke and I went into a dream 

Ah 





I read the news today oh, boy 

Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 

And though the holes were rather small 

They had to count them all 

Now they know how many holes 

it takes to fill the Albert Hall 

I'd love to turn you on

(Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon)

What'll you do when you get lonely

And nobody's waiting by your side?

You've been running and hiding much too long.

You know it's just your foolish pride.



Layla, you've got me on my knees.

Layla, I'm begging, darling please.

Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.



I tried to give you consolation

When your old man had let you down.

Like a fool, I fell in love with you,

Turned my whole world upside down.



Chorus



Let's make the best of the situation

Before I finally go insane.

Please don't say we'll never find a way

And tell me all my love's in vain.

(Sitting On) The Dock Of The Bay -- Otis Redding
****************************************



Sittin' in the morning sun

I'll be sittin' when the evening comes

Watching the ships roll in

Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

Watching the tide roll away

Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time



I left my home in Georgia

Headed for the Frisco bay

'Cos I've had nothing to live for

And look like nothing's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay

Watching the tide roll away

Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time



Look like nothing's gonna change

Everything still remains the same

I can't do what ten people tell me to do

So I guess I'll remain the same, listen



Sittin' here resting my bones

And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen

2000 miles I've roamed 

Just to make this dock my home

Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay

Watching the tide roll away

Ooh wee, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

Help! 



Help! I need somebody,

Help! Not just anybody,

Help! You know I need someone, help.



When I was younger, so much younger than today,

I never needed anybody's help in any way.

But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured,

Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors.



Help me if you can, I'm feeling down

And I do appreciate you being around.

Help me get my feet back on the ground,

Won't you please, please help me?



And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,

My independence seems to vanish in the haze.

But ev'ry now and then I feel so insecure,

I know that I just need you like I've never done before.



Help me if you can, I'm feeling down

And I do appreciate you being around.

Help me get my feet back on the ground,

Won't you please, please help me?



When I was younger, so much younger than today,

I never needed anybody's help in any way.

But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured,

Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

Won't you please,

Please help me,

Help me,

I Walk The Line -- Johnny Cash
****************************************



I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

Stairway To Heaven -- Led Zeppelin
****************************************



There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
And she's buying the stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven. 

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who stand looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 

And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 

And she's buying the stairway to heaven.

Please allow me to introduce myself 

I'm a man of wealth and taste 

I've been around for a long, long years 

Stole many a man's soul and faith 



And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 

Had his moment of doubt and pain 

Made damn sure that Pilate 

Washed his hands and sealed his fate 



Pleased to meet you 

Hope you guess my name 

But what's puzzling you 

Is the nature of my game 



I stuck around St. Petersburg 

When I saw it was a time for a change 

Killed the czar and his ministers 

Anastasia screamed in vain 



I rode a tank 

Held a general's rank 

When the blitzkrieg raged 

And the bodies stank 



Pleased to meet you 

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 

Ah, what's puzzling you 

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah 

(woo woo, woo woo) 



I watched with glee 

While your kings and queens 

Fought for ten decades 

For the gods they made 

(woo woo, woo woo) 



I shouted out, 

"Who killed the Kennedys?" 

When after all 

It was you and me 

(who who, who who) 



Let me please introduce myself 

I'm a man of wealth and taste 

And I laid traps for troubadours 

Who get killed before they reached Bombay 

(woo woo, who who) 



Pleased to meet you 

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 

(who who)

But what's puzzling you 

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby 

(who who, who who) 



Pleased to meet you 

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 

But what's confusing you 

Is just the nature of my game 

(woo woo, who who) 



Just as every cop is a criminal 

And all the sinners saints 

As heads is tails 

Just call me Lucifer 

'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 

(who who, who who) 



So if you meet me 

Have some courtesy 

Have some sympathy, and some taste 

(woo woo)

Use all your well-learned politesse 

Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 

(woo woo, woo woo) 



Pleased to meet you 

Hope you guessed my name, um yeah 

(who who)

But what's puzzling you 

Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down 

(woo woo, woo woo) 



Woo, who 

Oh yeah, get on down 

Oh yeah 

Oh yeah! 

(woo woo) 



Tell me baby, what's my name 

Tell me honey, can ya guess my name 

Tell me baby, what's my name 

I tell you one time, you're to blame 



Oh, who 

woo, woo 

Woo, who 

Woo, woo 

Woo, who, who 

Woo, who, who 

Oh, yeah 



What's my name

But only now my love has grown



And it gets stronger, in every way

And it gets deeper, let me say

And it gets higher, day by day



CHORUS:

And do I love you my oh my

Yeh river deep mountain high

If I lost you would I cry

Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby



When you were a young boy

Did you have a puppy That always followed you around

Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy

No I'll never let you down



Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows

And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows

And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring

And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing

And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet

And I love you baby, river deep mountain high

In your eyes when I reach for you

And girl you're starting to criticize

little things I do

It makes me just feel like crying baby

'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying



You've lost that loving feeling

Oh that loving feeling

Bring back that loving feeling

Now it's gone gone gone

And I can't go on

No-oh-oh



Baby baby I get down on my knees for you

If you would only love me like you used to do

We had a love

A love a love you don't find every day

So don't...don't...don't let it slip away



Bring back that loving feeling

Oh, that loving feeling

Bring back that loving feeling

Now it's gone...gone...gone...

And I can't go on...

I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.


(Chorus:)
Take a load off Annie, take a load for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."

(Chorus)

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day.
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"

(Chorus)

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."

(Chorus)

Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one.
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.

Georgia On My Mind -- Ray Charles
****************************************



Georgia-Georgia 
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
I said Georgia-Georgia
A song of you comes as sweet and clear as moon light through the pines
Other arms reach out to me, Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you
I said Georgia-Oh Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Oh her arms reach out to me, Oh her eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you. 
Ohhhh Georgia-Georgia
No peace-no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
I said just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Heartbreak Hotel -- Elvis Presley
****************************************



Well, since my baby left me, well Iíve found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street, at Heartbreak Hotel
Well, I've been, I've been just so lonely, baby
well, I'm so lonely
I've been just so lonely I could die

Although it's always crowded, you still can find some room
for brokenhearted lovers to cry there in their gloom
and be so, and they get so lonely, baby,
well they get so lonely, well, they're so lonely they could die

Now the bellhop's tears keep flowiní,
the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, theyíve been so long on Lonely Street
they'll never, never look back, and they get so
and they get so lonely, baby, well, theyíre so lonely
well, they're so lonely they could die

Well, now if your baby leaves you, and you've got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel
Well, you will be, you will be feeling so lonely, baby,
well, you will be lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die

Repeat lines 6 - 9 (with changes to lines 8-9)
Although it's always crowded, you still can find some room
for brokenhearted lovers to cry there in their gloom
and they get so, and they get so lonely, baby,
well theyíre so lonely, well, theyíll be so lonely they could die

Bridge Over Troubled Water -- Simon And Garfunkel
****************************************



When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl,
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

All Along The Watchtower -- Jimi Hendrix
****************************************



"There must be some kind of way out of here,"

said the joker to the thief,

"There's too much confusion,

I can't get no relief.

Businessmen they drink my wine,

plowmen dig my earth

None of them along the line know what any of it is worth"



"No reason to get excited,"

the thief, he kindly spoke

"There are many here among us

who feel that life is but a joke

But you and I, we've been through that

and this is not our fate

So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"



All along the watchtower

Princes kept the view

While all the women came and went

Barefoot servants, too



Outside in the cold distance

A wildcat did growl

Two riders were approaching

And the wind began to howl

Hotel California -- The Eagles
****************************************



On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair 
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air 
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light 
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway; 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself, 
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell' 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say... 

Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face 
Plenty of room at the Hotel California 
Any time of year, you can find it here 

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes Benz 
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends 
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. 
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget 
So I called up the Captain, 'Please bring me my wine' 
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since 1969' 
And still those voices are calling from far away 
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say... 

Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely Place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face 
They livin' it up at the Hotel California 
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis 

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice 
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' 
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast 
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast 
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door 
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before 
'Relax' said the nightman, We are programed to receive. 
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave

The Tracks Of My Tears -- Smokey Robinson
****************************************



People say I'm the life of the party

'cause I tell a joke or two

Although I might be laughing loud and hearty

Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face

You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace

The tracks of my tears..

I need you, need you

Since you left me if you see me with another girl

Seeming like I'm having fun

Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute

Because you're the permanent one..

So take a good look at my face

You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace

The tracks of my tears..

I need you, need you

Outside I'm masquerading

Inside my hope is fading

Just a clown oh yeah

Since you put me down

My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you..

So take a good look at my face

You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace

The tracks of my tears

The Message -- Grandmaster Flash
****************************************



It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder 
How I keep from going under 
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder 
How I keep from going under 

Broken glass everywhere 
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just donít care 
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise 
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice 
Rats in the front room, rodents in the back 
Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat 
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far 
Cause a man with a tow-truck repossessed my car 

Chorus: 
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge 
I'm trying not to lose my head, ah huh-huh-huh 
[2nd and 5th: ah huh-huh-huh] 
[4th: say what?]
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder 
How I keep from going under 
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder 
How I keep from going under 

Standing on the front stoop, hangin' out the window 
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow 
Crazy lady livin' in a bag 
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag-hag 
Said she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
The Zircon Princess seemed to lost her senses 
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps 
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home 
She went to the city and got social security 
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own 

[2nd Chorus] 

My brother's doing best on my mother's TV
She says: ìYou watch it too much, itís just not healthy!î 
ìAll My Childrenî in the daytime, ìDallasî at night 
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight 
The bill collectors they ring my phone 
And scare my wife when I'm not home 
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation 
I canít take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station 
Neon King Kong standin' on my back 
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacrophiliac 
A mid-ranged migraine, cancered membrane 
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane 

[3rd Chorus] 

My son said: îDaddy I don't wonna go to school 
Cause the teacher's a jerk!î, he must think I'm a fool 
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper 
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper 
Iíll dance to the beat, shuffle my feet 
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps 
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey 
They pushed that girl in front of the train 
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again 
Stabbed that man right in his heart 
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start 
I can't walk through the park, cause it's crazy after dark 
Keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run 
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jar 
Hear them say: ìYou want some more livin' on a seesaw?î 

[4th Chorus] 

A child is born with no state of mind 
Blind to the ways of mankind 
God is smiling on you but he's frowning too 
Because only God knows what youíll go through 
Youíll grow in the ghetto, living second rate 
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate 
The places youíre playiní, where you stay 
Looks like one great big alley way 
You'll admire all the number book takers 
Thugs, pimps, pushers and the big money makers 
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens 
And you wonna grow up to be just like them, huh, 
Smugglers, scrambles, burglars, gamblers 
Pickpockets, peddlers even panhandlers 
You say: ìI'm cool, I'm no fool!î 
But then you wind up dropping out of high school 
Now you're unemployed, all non-void 
Walking ëround like you're Pretty Boy Floyd 
Turned stickup kid, look what youíve done did 
Got sent up for a eight year bid 
Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag 
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag 
Being used and abused to serve like hell 
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell 
It was plain to see that your life was lost 
You was cold and your body swung back and forth 
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song 
Of how you lived so fast and died so young 

[5th Chorus]

When Doves Cry -- Prince

Dig if U will the picture
Of U and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can U my darling
Can U picture this?
Dream if U can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and U
How can U just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold
Maybe U're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
Touch if U will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
U've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase U
Even doves have pride
How could U just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold
Maybe U're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
How can U just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold (U know, U know he's 2 bold)
Maybe U're just like my mother (Maybe U're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream? Why?)
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
When doves cry (When doves cry) (When doves cry) {x2}
Don't cry (Don't cry)
Oh yeah {x6}
When doves cry {x3}

When A Man Loves A Woman -- Percy Sledge
****************************************



When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothing else 
He'll trade the world 
For the good thing he's found 
If she is bad he can't see it 
She can do no wrong 
Turn his back on his best friend 
If he put her down 

When a man loves a woman 
Spend his very last dime 
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs 
He'd give up all his comfort 
Sleep out in the rain 
If she said that's the way it ought to be 

Well, this man loves his woman 
I gave you everything I had 
Tryin' to hold on to your costless love 
Baby, please don't treat me bad 

When a man loves a woman 
Down deep in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she is playing him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Lovin' eyes can't ever see 

Well, this man loves his woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your costless love.
Baby, please don't treat me bad.

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul,
She can bring him such misery.
If she is playing him for a fool,
He's the last one to know:
Lovin' eyes can never see.

When a man loves a woman 
She can do no wrong 
He can never want some other girl 
Yes when a man loves a woman 
I know exactly how he feels 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world 

When a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels.....

A Whiter Shade Of Pale -- Procul Harum
****************************************



We skipped a light fandango,
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor.
I was feeling kind of seasick,
But the crowd called out for more.
The room was humming harder,
As the ceiling flew away.
When we called out for another drink,
The waiter brought a tray.

And so it was that later,
As the miller told his tale,
That her face at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale.

She said there is no reason,
And the truth is plain to see
That I wandered through my playing cards,
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast.
And although my eyes were open,
They might just as well have been closed.

And so it was later,
As the miller told his tale,
That her face at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale.

Billie Jean -- Michael Jackson
****************************************



She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round

She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round



She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene

Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round



People always told me be careful of what you do

And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

And mother always told me be careful of who you love

And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth



Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son



For forty days and for forty nights

The law was on her side

But who can stand when she's in demand

Her schemes and plans

'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice

(Do think twice)



She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me

Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)

'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby



People always told me be careful of what you do

And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

She came and stood right by me

Then the smell of sweet perfume

This happened much too soon

She called me to her room



Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son



Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son



She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son



She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one



Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover



Billie Jean is

Billie Jean is

Billie Jean is



Not my lover

Not my lover

Not my lover

Not my lover



Billie Jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)

Billie Jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)

Billie Jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)

Billie Jean is not my lover (she is just a girl)



Billie Jean is

Billie Jean is



Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover



Billie Jean is

Billie Jean is



Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover



Billie Jean is

Billie Jean is

The Times They Are A-changin' -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Come gather round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a changing

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
And keep your eyes open, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh the loser will be later to win
For the times, they are a changing

Come senators, congressmen, please head the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be her that has stalled
The battle outside ragging will soon shake your windows
And rattle your hall
For the times, they are a changing

Come mothers and fathers all over this land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughter are beyond your command
Your old role is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
For the times they are a changing

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one will later be fast
And the present now will soon be the past
The order is rapidly fading
The first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a changing

Let me be the one you come running to

Let's, let's stay together

Lovin' you whether, whether

Times are good or bad, happy or sad



Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad



Why, why some people break up

Then turn around and make up

I just can't see

You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)

Staying around you is all I see

(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together

Loving you whether, whether

There's somethin' happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun, over there
Tellin' me I got to beware

(I think it's time we)
Stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

There's battle lines bein' drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speakin' their minds
Gettin' so much resistance from behind

(It's time we)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and carryin' signs
Mostly sayin', "hooray for our side"

(It's time we)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

(We better)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(We better)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(We better)
Stop, now, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

Stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

Redemption Song -- Bob Marley
****************************************



Old pirates, yes, they rob I,
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I from the bottomless pit,
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty,
We forward in this generation triumphantly

Chorus
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had, redemption songs,
redemption songs,

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
None but ourselves can free our minds,
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time,
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say THAT it's part of it,
We've got to fulfill the book.

I sure would be delighted with your company,

come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone

way over in the corner weepin' all alone.

The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block 

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.



Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,

Tangled Up In Blue -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Early one morning the sun was shining - I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all - if her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress; papa's bank book wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road - rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows I paid some dues getting through

Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met - soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could - abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me as I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue"

Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods working as a cook, for a spell
But, I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans, though I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of the Delacroix
But, all the while I was alone the past was close behind
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
And, later on when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath; she studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe

Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said.  "You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century
And everyone of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul from me to you

Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague street - a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air
Then he started in to dealing with slaves and something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside
And when it finally - the bottom fell out - I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew

Tangled up in blue

So, now I'm going back again - I got to get to her, somehow
All the people we used to know - they're an illusion to me, now
Some are mathematicians, and some are carpenter's wives
I don't know how it all got started, or don't know what they're doing with their lives
But, me, I'm still on the road heading for another joint
We always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point of view

Tangled up in blue

I could smile for a while 
Kd:	but I saw you last night 
You held my hand so tight 
When you stopped to say hello 
Roy:  you wished me well 
You couldn't tell that 
I've been crying over you, 
Crying over you and you said &amp;quot;so long&amp;quot; 
Left me standing all alone, 
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying 
It's hard to understand 
Kd:	  but the touch of your hand can start me crying 
 
Roy:  I thought that I was over you 
But it's true, so true 
I love you even more than I did before 
But darling, what can I do?  
For you don't love me 
Kd:	  and I'll always be 
Crying over you, crying over you 
 
Roy:	 yes now you're gone 
Both:  and from this moment on, I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying 
Yeah, crying, crying over you

Walk On By -- Dionne Warwick
****************************************



If you see me walking down the street

And I start to cry each time we meet

Walk on by, walk on by



Make believe

that you don't see the tears

Just let me grieve

in private 'cause each time I see you

I break down and cry

And walk on by (don't stop)

And walk on by (don't stop)

And walk on by



I just can't get over losing you

And so if I seem broken and blue

Walk on by, walk on by



Foolish pride

Is all that I have left

So let me hide

The tears and the sadness you gave me

When you said goodbye

Walk on by

and walk on by

and walk by (don't stop)



Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride

Is all that I have left

So let me hide

The tears and the sadness you gave me

When you said goodbye

Walk on by (don't stop)

and walk on by (don't stop)

and walk by (don't stop)

Summertime Blues -- Cochran Eddie
****************************************



I'm gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and try to get a date
My boss says, "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and pop told me, "Son you gotta make some money,
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Well you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my congressman and he said Quote:
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I once had a girl 

Or should I say she once had me 

She showed me her room 

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 



She asked me to stay 

And she told me to sit anywhere 

So I looked around 

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 



I sat on a rug biding my time 

drinking her wine 

We talked until two and then she said 

"it's time for bed" 



She told me she worked 

in the morning and started to laugh 

I told her I didn't 

and crawled off to sleep in the bath 



And when I awoke I was alone 

This bird had flown 

So I lit a fire 

Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

Hey that's me and I want you only 

Don't turn me home again 

I just can't face myself alone again 

Don't run back inside 

Darling you know just what I'm here for 

So you're scared and you're thinking 

That maybe we ain't that young anymore 

Show a little faith there's magic in the night 

You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright 

Oh and that's alright with me 



You can hide 'neath your covers 

And study your pain 

Make crosses from your lovers 

Throw roses in the rain 

Waste your summer praying in vain 

For a saviour to rise from these streets 

Well now I'm no hero 

That's understood 

All the redemption I can offer girl 

Is beneath this dirty hood 

With a chance to make it good somehow 

Hey what else can we do now ? 

Except roll down the window 

And let the wind blow 

Back your hair 

Well the night's busting open 

These two lanes will take us anywhere 

We got one last chance to make it real 

To trade in these wings on some wheels 

Climb in back 

Heaven's waiting on down the tracks 

Oh-oh come take my hand 

We're riding out tonight to case the promised land 

Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road 

Lying out there like a killer in the sun 

Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run 

Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold 

Thunder Road 



Well I got this guitar 

And I learned how to make it talk 

And my car's out back 

If you're ready to take that long walk 

From your front porch to my front seat 

The door's open but the ride it ain't free 

And I know you're lonely 

For words that I ain't spoken 

But tonight we'll be free 

All the promises'll be broken 

There were ghosts in the eyes 

Of all the boys you sent away 

They haunt this dusty beach road 

In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets 

They scream your name at night in the street 

Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet 

And in the lonely cool before dawn 

You hear their engines roaring on 

But when you get to the porch they're gone 

On the wind so Mary climb in 

It's town full of losers 

And I'm pulling out of here to win

Love Is A Burning Thing

And It Makes A Fiery Ring

Bound By Wild Desire

I Fell Into A Ring Of Fire



CHORUS:

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire

I Went Down, Down, Down

And The Flames Went Higher



And It Burns, Burns, Burns

The Taste Of Love Is Sweet

When Hearts Like Ours Meet

I Fell For You Like A Child

Oh, But The Fire Went Wild

My Girl -- Temptations
****************************************



song: My Girl (December, 1964)
artist: Temptations
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day.
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May.
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).
I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooooh.
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame.
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim.
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
with my girl.
I've even got the month of May
with my girl (fade)

****************************************



All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk on a Winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin' on such a Winter's day

Stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know, the preacher liked the cold - he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' on such a Winter's day

All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk on a Winter's day
If I didn't tell her, I could leave today
California dreamin' on such a Winter's day
California dreamin' on such a Winter's day
California dreamin' on such a Winter's day

In the still of the night 

I held you 

Held you tight 

'Cause I love 

Love you so 

Promise i'll never 

Let you go 

In the still of the night 



I remember 

That night in May 

The stars were bright above 

I'll hope and I'll pray 

To keep 

Your precious love 

Well before the light 

Hold me again 

With all of your might 

In the still of the night 



So before the light 

Hold me again 

With all of your might 

In the still of the night 

In the still of the night

We're caught in a trap

I can't walk out

Because I love you too much baby



Why can't you see

What you're doing to me

When you don't believe a word I say?



We can't go on together

With suspicious minds

And we can't build our dreams

On suspicious minds



So, if an old friend I know

Drops by to say hello

Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?



Here we go again

Asking where I've been

You can't see these tears are real

I'm crying



We can't go on together

With suspicious minds

And be can't build our dreams

On suspicious minds



Oh let our love survive

Or dry the tears from your eyes

Let's don't let a good thing die



When honey, you know

I've never lied to you

Mmm yeah, yeah

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For -- U2
****************************************



I have climbed highest mountain

I have run through the fields

Only to be with you

Only to be with you



I have run 

I have crawled

I have scaled these city walls

These city walls

Only to be with you



But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for



I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips

It burned like fire

This burning desire



I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of a devil

It was warm in the night

I was cold as a stone



But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for



I believe in the kingdom come

Then all the colors will bleed into one

Bleed into one

Well yes I'm still running



You broke the bonds and you

Loosed the chains

Carried the cross

Of my shame

Of my shame

You know I believed it



But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for...

You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name
All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

Roll Over Beethoven they're rockin' in two by two.

Well, if you feelin' like it
go get your lover, then reel and rock it.
Roll it over and move on up just
a trifle further and reel and rock with it,
roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues.

You Can't Always Get What You Want -- Rolling Stones

I saw her today at the reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she was gonna meet her connection 
At her feet was her footloose man 

you can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometime you  might find 
You get what you need 
I went down to the demonstration 
To get my fair share of abuse 
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration 
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse" 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You get what you need 

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
To get your prescription filled 
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy 
And man, did he look pretty ill 
We decided that we would have a soda 
My favorite flavor, cherry red 
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy 
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" 
I said to him 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You get what you need 
Oh yes 
You get what you need--yeah, oh baby 

I saw her today at the reception 
In her glass was a bleeding man 
She was practiced at the art of deception 
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need

Chop it down with the edge of my hand 

Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island 

Might even raise just a little sand 

'Cause I'm a voodoo child 

Lord knows I'm a voodoo child 



I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time 

I'll give it right back to you one of these days 

I said, I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time 

I'll give it right back to you one of these days 

And if I don't meet you no more in this world 

Then I'll, I'll meet you in the next one 

And don't be late, don't be late

Living For The City -- Stevie Wonder
****************************************



A boy is born in hard time Mississippi 

Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty 

His parents give him love and affection 

To keep him strong moving in the right direction 

Living just enough, just enough for the city...ee ha! 

His father works some days for fourteen hours 

And you can bet he barely makes a dollar 

His mother goes to scrub the floors for many 

And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny 

Living just enough, just enough for the city... yeah! 

His sister's black but she is sho'nuff pretty 

Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy 

To walk to school she's got to get up early 

Her clothes are old but never are they dirty 

Living just enough, just enough for the city...um hum 

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many 

His patience's long but soon he won't have any 

To find a job is like a haystack needle 

Cause where he lives they don't use colored people 

Living just enough, just enough for the city... 

Living just enough... 

For the city... ooh, ooh 

(Repeat several times) 

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty 

He spends his life walking the streets of New York City 

He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution 

He tried to vote but to him there's no solution 

Living just enough, just enough for the city... 

yeah, yeah, yeah! 

I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow 

And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow 

This place is cruel no where could be much colder 

If we don't change the world will soon be over 

Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city!!!! 

La, La, La, La, La, La, 

Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da 

Da Da Da Da Da Da 

Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da

The Boxer -- Simon &amp; Garfunkel
****************************************



I'm just a poor boy
though my story's seldom told

I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles

such are promises:
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
and disregards the rest
mh -- mh.

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
in the company of strangers
in the quiet of a railway station

running scared.
Laying low
seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged
people go
looking for the places only they would know.

Lie-la-lie
...

Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job

but I get no offers

just a comeon from the hores on Seventh Avenue.
I do declare
there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
oh la la
la la
la la.

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
and wishing I was gone
going home
where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me

leading me going home
mh -- mh.

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade

and he carries the reminders of ev'ry glove that laid him down
or cut him till he cried out in his anger an his shame:
I am leaving, I am leaving!
but the fighter still remains

Mr. Tambourine Man -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.



Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,

Vanished from my hand,

Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.

My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,

I have no one to meet

And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.



Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.



Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,

My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,

My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels

To be wanderin'.

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade

Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,

I promise to go under it.



Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.



Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,

It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run

And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.

And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme

To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,

I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're

Seein' that he's chasing.



Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.



Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,

Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,

The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,

Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,

Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,

With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,

Let me forget about today until tomorrow.



Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Brown Eyed Girl -- Van Morrison
****************************************



Hey where did we go, 

Days when the rains came 

Down in the hollow, 

Playin' a new game, 

Laughing and a running hey, hey 

Skipping and a jumping 

In the misty morning fog with 

Our hearts a thumpin' and you 

My brown eyed girl, 

You my brown eyed girl. 



Whatever happened 

To Tuesday and so slow 

Going down the old mine 

With a transistor radio 

Standing in the sunlight laughing, 

Hiding behind a rainbow's wall, 

Slipping and sliding 

All along the water fall, with you 

My brown eyed girl, 

You my brown eyed girl. 



Do you remember when we used to sing, 

Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da 



So hard to find my way, 

Now that I'm all on my own. 

I saw you just the other day, 

My how you have grown, 

Cast my memory back there, Lord 

Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout 

Making love in the green grass 

Behind the stadium with you 

My brown eyed girl 

You my brown eyed girl 



Do you remember when we used to sing 

Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da.

I've been loving you
Too long, to stop now
You were tied
And you want to be free
My love is grown stronger
As you become a habit to me

Ooo, been loving you, too long
I don't wanna stop, now
Oh, no

With you my life 
Has been so wonderful
I can't stop, now 

You were tied 
And your love is growing cold
My love is going stronger
As our affair, affair, grow old

I've been loving you, oh too long, long
To stop now
Ooh, ooh-oh

I've been loving you-ooo-ooo 
A l'il too longer on 
I don't wanna stop it, now 
Ooh, ooh
Don't make me stop, then

Ooh, beggin' you
Down on my knees
Please don't make me come beg
Lord! I love you, I love you!
With all my heart
And I can't stop, now 

Please!
Please!
Please!
Please, don't

FADES- 

Don't make me stop loving
All my heart and soul
Crying
I'm in love
Ooo, given you too much.

I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry -- Hank Williams
****************************************



Hear that lonesome whippoorwill, 
He sounds too blue to fly. 
The midnight train is whining low, 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by. 
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry. 

Did you ever see a robin weep, 
When leaves began to die? 
That means he's lost the will to live, 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky. 
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

Mama she done told me, 

Papa done told me too 

'Son, that gal your foolin' with, 

She ain't no good for you' 

But, that's all right, that's all right. 

That's all right now mama, anyway you do



I'm leaving town, baby 

I'm leaving town for sure 

Well, then you won't be bothered with 

Me hanging 'round your door 

Well, that's all right, that's all right. 

That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Up On The Roof -- The Drifters
****************************************



When this old world starts getting me down

And people are just too much for me to face

I climb way up to the top of the stars

And all my cares just drift right into space



On the roof it's peaceful as can be

And there the world below can't bother me

Let me tell you now



When I come home feeling tired and beat

I go up where the air is fresh and sweet

I get away from the hustling crowds

And all that rat race noise down in the street



On the roof's the only place I know

Where you just have to wish to make it so

Up on the roof



At night the stars put on a show for free

And darling you can share it all with me

I keep-a tellin' you



Right smack dab in the middle of town

I found a Paradise that's trouble-proof

And if this world starts getting you down

There's room enough for two up on the roof



Up on the roof..........

Honky Tonk Women -- Rolling Stones

I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis, 

She tried to take me upstairs for a ride. 

She had to heave me right across her shoulder 

'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind. 



It's the honky tonk women 

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues. 



I laid a divorcee in New York City, 

I had to put up some kind of a fight. 

The lady then she covered me with roses, 

She blew my nose and then she blew my mind. 



It's the honky tonk women 

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues. 



(Yeah!)  It's the honky tonk women. 

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

Loving you

Isn't the right thing to do

How can I ever change things

That I feel



If I could

Maybe I'd give you my world

How can I

When you won't take it from me



You can go your own way

Go your own way

You an call it

Another lonely day

You can go your own way

Go your own way



Tell me why

Everything turned around

Packing up

Shacking up is all you wanna do



If I could

Baby I'd give you my world

Open up

Everything's waiting for you



You can go your own way

Go your own way

You an call it

Another lonely day

You can go your own way

I Want You Back -- Jackson 5
****************************************



When I had you to myself

I didn't want you around

Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd

But some one picked you from the bunch

when love was all it took

Now it's much too late for me to take a second look.

Oh baby give me one more chance

won't you please take me

back to your heart

Oh darlin I was blind to let you go

But now since I see you in his arms

I want you back

Yes I do now

I want you back

Ooh ooh baby

I want you back

Ya ya ya ya

Na na na na

Tryin to live without your love

Is one long sleepless night

Let me show you girl

that I know wrong from right

Every street you walked right on

With a tear stain on the ground

Following the girl

I didn't even want around

Let me tell you now

Oh baby all I need is one more chance

(to show you that I love you)

Won't you please take me

(back to your heart)

Oh darlin I was blind to let you go

(let you go baby)

But now since I see you in his arms

Uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh buh(5 times)

All I want

All I need

All I want

All I need

Spare me of this cause

Gimme back our love oh baby

Is a suitcase and trunk 

And the only time he's satisfied 

Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children 

Not to do what I have done 

Spend your lives in sin and misery 

In the House of the Rising Sun 



Well, I got one foot on the platform 

The other foot on the train 

I'm goin' back to New Orleans 

To wear that ball and chain 



Well, there is a house in New Orleans

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl
You see man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light
To take as out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark
This is a man's man's man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about the little betty baby girl
And the baby boys
Man makes them happy
Cause man made them toys
And after man made everyhing
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other men
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness

Tonight you're mine completely 
You give you love so sweetly

But will you love me tomorrow 

Is this a lasting treasure 
Or just a moment's pleasure? 
Can I believe the magic of your sighs? 
Will you still love me tomorrow? 

Tonight with words unspoken 
You say that I'm the only one 
But will my heart be broken 
When the night meets the morming sun? 

I'd like to love that your love 
Is love I can't be sure of 
So tell me now, and I won't ask again 
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Changes -- David Bowie
****************************************



I still don't know what I was waiting for

And my time was running wild

A million dead-end streets

Every time I thought I'd got it made

It seemed the taste was not so sweet

So I turned myself to face me

But I've never caught a glimpse

Of how the others must see the faker

I'm much too fast to take that test



Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Don't want to be a richer man

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Just gonna have to be a different man

Time may change me

But I can't trace time



I watch the ripples change their size

But never leave the stream

Of warm impermanence and

So the days float through my eyes

But still the days seem the same

And these children that you spit on

As they try to change their worlds

Are immune to your consultations

They're quite aware of what they're going through



Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Don't tell them to grow up and out of it

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Where's your shame

You've left us up to our necks in it

Time may change me

But you can't trace time



Strange fascination, fascinating me

Changes are taking the pace I'm going through



Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes

(Turn and face the stranger)

Ch-ch-Changes

Pretty soon you're gonna get a little older

Time may change me

But I can't trace time

I said that time may change me

But I can't trace time

Rock And Roll Music -- Chuck Berry
****************************************



Just let me hear some of that

Rock And Roll Music,

Any old way you choose it;

It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,

Any old time you use it.

It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,

If you want to dance with me,

If you want to dance with me.



I've got no kick againt modern jazz,

Unless they try to play it too darn fast;

And change the beauty of the melody,

Until they sounded like a symphony,

That's why I go for that

Rock And Roll Music ...



I took my loved one over cross the tracks

So she can hear my man await a sax,

I must admit the have a rockin' band,

Man they were going like a hurricane

That's why I go for that

Rock and Roll music .....



Way down South they gave a jubilee,

the jockey folks they had a jamboree,

They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,

The folks dancin' they all got shook up

And started playin' that

Rock and Roll music ....



Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,

I'm in the mood to dig a mambo;

It's way to early for a congo,

So keep a rockin' that piano

So I can hear some of that

Rock And Roll Music ...

Born To Be Wild -- Steppenwolf
****************************************



Get your motor running 

Head out on the highway

Looking for adventure

In whatever comes our way



Yeah, darling

Gonna make it happen

Take the world in a love embrace

Fire all of your guns at once and

Explode into space



I like smoke and lightning

Heavy metal thunder

Racing in the wind

And the feeling that I'm under



Yeah, darling

Gonna make it happen

Take the world in a love embrace

Fire all of your guns at once and

Explode into space



Like a true nature child 

We were born

Born to be wild

We have climbed so high

Never want to die

Born to be wild 

Born to be wild

Maggie May -- Rod Stewart
****************************************



Wake up Maggie, I think I've got something to say to you

It's late September and I really should be back at school

I know I keep you amused

But I fell I'm being used

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home

Just to save you from being alone

You stole my heart and that's what really hurts



The morning sun when it's in your eyes really shows your age

But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes

My love you didn't need to coax

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home

Just to save you from being alone

You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without



All I needed was a friend to lend a helping hand

But you turned into a lover and mother, what a lover, you wore me out

All you did was wreck my bed

And in the morning kick me in the head

Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home

'Cause you didn't want to be alone

You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried



I suppose I could collect my books and go on back to school

Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living at playing pool

Or find myself a rock and roll band

That needs a helping hand

Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face

You made a first class fool out of me

But I'm as blind as a fool can be

You stole my heart but I love you anyway

I'd never seen your face

I'll get on back home, one of these days

With Or Without You -- U2
****************************************



See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait....without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

Who Do You Love -- Bo Diddley
****************************************



(ellas mcdaniel) 1956 
 
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire, 
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie, 
I got a brand new house on the roadside, 
Made from rattlesnake hide, 
I got a brand new chimney made on top, 
Made out of a human skull, 
Now come on take a walk with me, arlene, 
And tell me, who do you love?  
 
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
 
Tombstone hand and a graveyard mine, 
Just 22 and I don't mind dying. 
 
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
 
I rode around the town, use a rattlesnake whip, 
Take it easy arlene, don't give me no lip, 
 
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
 
Night was dark, but the sky was blue, 
Down the alley, the ice-wagon flew, 
Heard a bump, and somebody screamed, 
You should have heard just what I seen. 
 
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
 
Arlene took me by my hand, 
And she said ooowee bo, you know I understand. 
 
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?

Won't Get Fooled Again -- Who
****************************************



We'll be fighting in the streets



With our children at our feet



And the morals that they worship will be gone



And the men who spurred us on



Sit in judgement of all wrong



They decide and the shotgun sings the song



 



I'll tip my hat to the new constitution



Take a bow for the new revolution



Smile and grin at the change all around



Pick up my guitar and play



Just like yesterday



Then I'll get on my knees and pray



We don't get fooled again



 



The change, it had to come



We knew it all along



We were liberated from the fold, that's all



And the world looks just the same



And history ain't changed



'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war



 



I'll tip my hat to the new constitution



Take a bow for the new revolution



Smile and grin at the change all around



Pick up my guitar and play



Just like yesterday



Then I'll get on my knees and pray



We don't get fooled again



No, no!



 



I'll move myself and my family aside



If we happen to be left half alive



I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky



Though I know that the hypnotized never lie



Do ya?



 



There's nothing in the streets



Looks any different to me



And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye



And the parting on the left



Are now parting on the right



And the beards have all grown longer overnight



 



I'll tip my hat to the new constitution



Take a bow for the new revolution



Smile and grin at the change all around



Pick up my guitar and play



Just like yesterday



Then I'll get on my knees and pray



We don't get fooled again



Don't get fooled again



No, no!



 



Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!



 



Meet the new boss



Same as the old boss

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 

While my guitar gently weeps 

I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping 

Still my guitar gently weeps 



I don't know why nobody told you 

how to unfold you love 

I don't know how someone controlled you 

they bought and sold you 



I look at the world and I notice it's turning 

While my guitar gently weeps 

With every mistake we must surely be learning 

Still my guitar gently weeps 



I don't know how you were diverted 

you were perverted too 

I don't know how you were inverted 

no one alerted you 



I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 

While my guitar gently weeps

Still my guitar gently weeps 



Oh, oh, oh

Your Song -- Elton John
****************************************



It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
  

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Ah, look at all the lonely people

Ah, look at all the lonely people



Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice

in the church where a wedding has been

Lives in a dream

Waits at the window, wearing the face 

that she keeps in a jar by the door

Who is it for



All the lonely people

Where do they all come from?

All the lonely people

Where do they all belong?



Father McKenzie, writing the words

of a sermon that no one will hear

No one comes near

Look at him working, darning his socks

in the night when there's nobody there

What does he care



All the lonely people

Where do they all come from?

All the lonely people

Where do they all belong?



Ah, look at all the lonely people

Ah, look at all the lonely people



Eleanor Rigby, died in the church

and was buried along with her name

Nobody came

Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt

from his hands as he walks from the grave

No one was saved



All the lonely people

Where do they all come from?

All the lonely people

Where do they all belong?

Well my heart went boom 

When I crossed that room 

And I held her hand in mine 



Oh we danced through the night 

And we held each other tight

Kashmir -- Led Zeppelin
****************************************



Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream 

I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been 

To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen 

They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed 



Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear 

But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear 

Oh, oh. 



Oh, I been flying... mama, there ain't no denyin' 

I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 



All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground 

And my eyes fill with sand, as I scan this wasted land 

Trying to find, trying to find where I've been. 



Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream 

Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream 

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again 

Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir. 



Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years 

With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear 

Ohh. 



When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah 

When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah 



Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down... 

Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so down 

Ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there 



Let me take you there. Let me take you there

Somebody went under a dock

And there they saw a rock

It wasn't a rock

It was a rock lobster



Motion in the ocean

His air hose broke

Lots of trouble

Lots of bubble

He was in a jam

S'in a giant clam



Down, down



Underneath the waves

Mermaids wavin'

Wavin' to mermen

Wavin' sea fans

Sea horses sailin'

Dolphins wailin'

Clam shells clappin'

Muscles flexin'

Flippers flippin'

Boy's in bikinis

Girls in surfboards

Everybody's rockin'

Everybody's fruggin'



Twistin' 'round the fire

Havin' fun

Bakin' potatoes

Bakin' in the sun



Put on your noseguard

Put on the lifeguard

Pass the tanning butter



Here comes a stingray

There goes a manta-ray

In walked a jelly fish

There goes a dogfish

Chased by a catfish

In flew a sea robin

Watch out for that piranha

There goes a narwhale

Me And Bobby Mcgee -- Janis Joplin
****************************************



Busted flat in Baton Rouge 

Waitin' for a train 

And I was feelin' near's faded as my jeans 

Bobby thumbed a diesel down 

Just before it rained 

And rode us all the way in to New Orleans 

I pulled my harpoon outta my dirty red bandana 

I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues- yeah 

Windshield wipers slapping time 

I was holding Bobby's hand in mine 

And we sang every song that driver knew 



CHORUS: 

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose 

Nothing- well no nothing honey if ain't free- yeah 

And feeling good was easy Lord when he sang the blues 

You know feeling good was good enough for me- hmm hmm 

Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee 

LA LA LA's 



From the Kentucky cole mines 

To the California sun 

Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul 

Through all kinds of weather 

Through everything we done 

Yeah Bobbby baby kept me from the cold 

One day up near Salinas Lord I let him slip away 

He's a lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it 

Well I trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday 

To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine 



CHORUS: 

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose 

Nothing- well that's all that Bobby left me- yeah 

Well feeling good was easy Lord when he sang the blues 

Feeling good was good enough for me- hmm hmm 

Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee 

LA LA LA's 

&amp; Naw Naw Naw's 



Hey Hey Hey Bobby McGee Yeah!

CHORUS

Don't want your lo-o-o-o-ove anymore

Don't want your ki-i-i-i-isses, that's for sure

I die each time I hear this sound

ìHere he co-o-o-o-omes, that's Cathy's clownî



I've gotta stand tall, you know a man can't crawl

But when he knows you tell lies and he hears 'em passin' by

He's not a man at all



CHORUS



When you see me shed a tear and you know that it's sincere

Dontcha think it's kinda sad that you're treatin' me so bad

Or don't you even care



CHORUS



FADE

That's Cathy's clown

That's Cathy's clown

Eight Miles High -- Byrds
****************************************



Eight miles high and when you touch down

You'll find that it's stranger than known

Signs in the street that say where you're going

Are somewhere just being their own



Nowhere is there to be found

Among those afraid of losing their ground

Mean grey town known for its sound

In places small, places unbound



Now the squares of moving storms

Some laughing, some just shapeless forms

Sidewalk scenes and black limosines

Some living, some standing alone

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do

Will make me feel alright



You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things

And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me

everything

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

You know I feel ok



When I'm home everything seems to be right

When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight



Owww!



So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

You know I feel ok



You know I feel alright

You know I feel alright

Left a good job in the city 

Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day 

And I never lost one minute of sleepin' 

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been 



Big wheel keep on turnin' 

Proud Mary keep on burnin' 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 



Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis 

Pumped a lot of tain down in New Orleans 

But I never saw the good side of the city 

'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen 



Big wheel keep on turnin' 

Proud Mary keep on burnin' 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 



If you come down to the river 

Bet you gonna find some people who live 

You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money 

People on the river are happy to give 



Big wheel keep on turnin' 

Proud Mary keep on burnin' 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 



Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river 

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

The Sound Of Silence -- Simon And Garfunkel
****************************************



Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision
That was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Beneath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share...
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

"Fools," said I, "you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows."
"Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence.

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming.
And the signs said: "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls,
And whisper'd in the sound of silence."

I Only Have Eyes for You -- The Flamingos
****************************************



My love must be a kind of blind love

I can't see anyone but you.



Are the stars out tonight?

I don't know if it's cloudy or bright

I Only Have Eyes For You, Dear.



The moon maybe high

but I can't see a thing in the sky,

'Cause I Only Have Eyes For You.



I don't know if we're in a garden,

or on a crowded avenue.



You are here

So am I

Maybe millions of people go by,

but they all disappear from view.

And I Only Have Eyes For You.

I'm waiting for my man

Twenty-six dollars in my hand

Up to Lexington, 125

Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive

I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?

Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around? 

Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind 

I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine 

I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black

Beat up shoes and a big straw hat

He's never early, he's always late

First thing you learn is you always gotta wait I'm waiting for my man

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs 

Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares 

He's got the works, gives you sweet taste

Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste 

I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout 

I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out 

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine

Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time

I'm waiting for my man

Bring The Noise -- Public Enemy
****************************************



Bass! how low can you go?  
Death row. what a brother knows. 
Once again, back is the incredible 
The thyme animal 
The incredible d, public enemy number one 
&amp;quot;five-o&amp;quot; said, &amp;quot;freeze!&amp;quot; and I got numb 
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?  
But it's the wax that the terminator x spun 
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell 
'cause a brother like me said, &amp;quot;well... 
...frarrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to 
What he can say to you, what you ought to do.&amp;quot; 
Follow for now, power of the people, say, 
&amp;quot;make a miracle, d, pump the lyrical&amp;quot; 
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win 
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again 
 
Chorus: turn it up! bring the noise! 
 
Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad 
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator 
Soul on roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope 
'cause the beats in the lines are so dope 
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting 
Me for 
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters 
Now across the country has us up for the war 
 
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait 
Till we get it right 
Radio stations I question their blackness 
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this 
 
Chorus: turn it up! bring the noise! 
 
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me 
My deejay is warm, he's x, I call him norm, ya know 
He can cut a record from side to side 
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide 
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll 
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man 
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know 
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too 
Whatcha gonna do? rap is not afraid of you 
Beat is for sonny bono, beat is for yoko ono 
Run-dmc first said a deejay could be a band 
Stand on it's feet, get you out your seat 
Beat is for eric b. and ll, as well, hell 
Wax is for anthrax, still it can rock bells 
Ever forever, universal, it will sell 
Time for me to exit, terminator x-it 
 
Chorus... 
 
From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose 
&amp;quot;stand, my man? the beat's the same with a boost toast 
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. why you ask?  
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as 
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate 
Don't need to wait, get the record straight 
Hey, posse's in effect, got the flavor terminator 
X to sign checks, play to get paid 
We got to check it out down on the avenue 
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you 
Yeah, I'm telling you...

I Can't Stop Loving You -- Ray Charles
****************************************



I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
(dreams of yesterday)
Those happy hours that we once knew
Tho' long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've apart

I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
(Those happy hours)Those happy hours (that we once new)that we once knew
(Tho' long ago)Tho' long ago, (they still make me blue)they still ma-a-ake me blue, (they say that time)they say that time (heals a broken heart)heals a broken heart
(but times stood still)Time has stood still (since we've been apart)since we went apart

I can't stop loving you, I said T've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome time
(sing a song, children)
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
(of yesterday)

Is this the real life -
Is this just fantasy -
Caught in a landslide -
No escape from reality -
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see -
Iím just a poor boy, I need no sympathy -
Because Iím easy come, easy go,
A little high, little low,
Anyway the wind blows, doesnít really matter to me,
To me

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now heís dead,
Mama, life had just begun,
But now Iíve gone and thrown it all away -
Mama ooo,
Didnít mean to make you cry -
If Iím not back again this time tomorrow -
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters -

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine -
Bodyís aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody-Iíve got to go -
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth -
Mama ooo - (any way the wind blows)
I donít want to die,
I sometimes wish Iíd never been born at all -

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the fandango -
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me -
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo Figaro ñ magnifico -
But Iím just a poor boy and nobody loves me -
Heís just a poor boy from a poor family -
Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
Easy come easy go -,will you let me go -
Bismillah! no -,we will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah! we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! we will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go -
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me -

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye -
So you think you can love me and leave me to die -
Oh baby - canít do this to me baby -
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here -

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters -, nothing really matters to me,

Any way the wind blows....

Folsom Prison Blues -- Johnny Cash
****************************************



I hear the train a comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on.
But that train keeps rollin' on down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son,
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns."
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry.

I bet there's rich folk eatin' from a fancy dining car.
They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
But those people keep a movin', and that's what tortures me.

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move it on over a little farther down the line,
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Fast Car -- Tracy Chapman
****************************************



You got a fast car 
I want a ticket to anywhere 
Maybe we make a deal 
Maybe together we can get somewhere 

Anyplace is better 
Starting from zero got nothing to lose 
Maybe we'll make something 
But me myself I got nothing to prove 

You got a fast car 
And I got a plan to get us out of here 
I been working at the convenience store 
Managed to save just a little bit of money 
We won't have to drive too far 
Just 'cross the border and into the city 
You and I can both get jobs 
And finally see what it means to be living 

You see my old man's got a problem 
He live with the bottle that's the way it is 
He says his body's too old for working 
I say his body's too young to look like his 
My mama went off and left him 
She wanted more from life than he could give 
I said somebody's got to take care of him 
So I quit school and that's what I did 

You got a fast car 
But is it fast enough so we can fly away 
We gotta make a decision 
We leave tonight or live and die this way 

I remember we were driving driving in your car 
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk 
City lights lay out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder 
And I had a feeling that I belonged 
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone 

You got a fast car 
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves 
You still ain't got a job 
And I work in a market as a checkout girl 
I know things will get better 
You'll find work and I'll get promoted 
We'll move out of the shelter 
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs 

I remember we were driving driving in your car 
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk 
City lights lay out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder 
And I had a feeling that I belonged 
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone 

You got a fast car 
And I got a job that pays all our bills 
You stay out drinking late at the bar 
See more of your friends than you do of your kids 
I'd always hoped for better 
Thought maybe together you and me would find it 
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere 
So take your fast car and keep on driving 

You got a fast car 
But is it fast enough so you can fly away 
You gotta make a decision 
You leave tonight or live and die this way

Lose Yourself -- Eminem
****************************************



[Intro] 
, if you had one shot or one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 

[Verse 1] 
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There is vomit on his sweater already 
Moms spagetti' he's nervous 
But on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out 
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now 
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW! 
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad 
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it 
He knows his whole back's to these ropes 
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that 
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows 
When he goes back to this mobile home 
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo 
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment 
And hope it don't collapse on him 

[Chorus] 
You better lose yourself in the music 
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You better lose yourself in the music 
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You better 

[Verse 2] 
Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping 
This world is mines for the taking 
Make me king as we move toward a new world order 
A normal life is boring 
But superstardom's close to post mortem 
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter 
Lonely roads got him 
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water 
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product 
They moved on to the next shmo who flows 
Who nose dove and sold nada 
And so the so proper 
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner 
But the beat goes on 
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
No more games, I'ma change for due called rage 
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the 
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer 
This is my life and these times are so hard 
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water 
My seed plus teeter-totter 
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna 
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her 
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot 
Another damn or not has gotten me to the point 
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot 
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mother-fucking option, Failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in 
DIK HEADSalem's Lot 
So here I go, it's my shot 
Feet fail me not 
This may be the only opportunity that I got 

[Chorus] 

[Outro] 
Duh doo 
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

****************************************



Words and Music by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong
It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember,
'cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him;
 never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.
(Spoken)
Mama just looked at him and said, "Son,
(Sung)
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
And when his died,
All he left us was alone."
Verse 2
Hey, mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.
(Spoken)
Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,
(To Chorus)

Losing My Religion -- REM
****************************************



Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

Both Sides, Now -- Joni Mitchell
****************************************



Rows and floes of angel hair 
And ice cream castles in the air 
And feather canyons ev'rywhere 
I've looked at clouds that way 
 
But now they only block the sun 
They rain and snow on ev'ryone 
So many things I would have done 
But clouds got in my way 
I've looked at clouds from both sides now 
From up and down, and still somehow 
It's cloud illusions I recall 
I really don't know clouds at all 
 
Moons and junes and ferris wheels 
The dizzy dancing way you feel 
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real 
I've looked at love that way 
 
But now it's just another show 
You leave 'em laughing when you go 
And if you care, don't let them know 
Don't give yourself away 
 
I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take, and still somehow 
It's love's illusions I recall 
I really don't know love at all 
 
Tears and fears and feeling proud 
To say &amp;quot;i love you&amp;quot; right out loud 
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds 
I've looked at life that way 
 
But now old friends are acting strange 
They shake their heads, they say I've changed 
Well something's lost, but something's gained 
In living ev'ry day 
 
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From win and lose and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all 
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From up and down, and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all

Dancing Queen -- ABBA
****************************************



You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen 
 
Friday night and the lights are low 
Looking out for the place to go 
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing 
You come in to look for a king 
Anybody could be that guy 
Night is young and the music's high 
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine 
You're in the mood for a dance 
And when you get the chance... 
 
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen 
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine 
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen 
 
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on 
Leave them burning and then you're gone 
Looking out for another, anyone will do 
You're in the mood for a dance 
And when you get the chance... 
 
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen 
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine 
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen

Dream On -- Aerosmith
****************************************



Every time I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It goes by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

Yeah, I know nobody knows
where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life
is in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and
from sages
You know it's true
All the things you do come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Dream On Dream On Dream On
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream On Dream On Dream On
Dream until your dream comes through
Dream On Dream On Dream On
Dream On Dream On
Dream On Dream On

Sing with me, sing for the year
sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away......

Paint It Black -- Rolling Stones
****************************************



I see a red door and I want it painted black 

No colors anymore I want them to turn black 

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes 

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 



I see a line of cars and they're all painted black 

With flowers and my love both never to come back 

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away 

Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day 



I look inside myself and see my heart is black 

I see my red door and it has been painted black 

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts 

It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black 



No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue 

I could not foresee this thing happening to you 



If I look hard enough into the settin' sun 

My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes 



I see a red door and I want it painted black 

No colors anymore I want them to turn black 

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes 

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 



Hmm, hmm, hmm,... 



I wanna see it painted, painted black 

Black as night, black as coal 

I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky 

I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black 

Yeah!

Well its been building up inside of me 

For oh I don't know how long

Something's bound to go wrong 



But she looks in my eyes 

And makes me realize 

And she says "Don't worry baby"

Everything will turn out alright 



Don't worry baby 

Don't worry baby

But I can't back down now 

I pushed the other guys too far 



She makes me come alive 

And makes me wanna drive 

When she says "Don't worry baby" 

Don't worry baby 

Don't worry baby 

Everything will turn out alright 



Don't worry baby 

Don't worry baby 

Don't worry baby 



She told me "Baby, when you race today 

Just take along my love with you 

And if you know how much I loved you 

Baby nothing could go wrong with you" 



Oh what she does to me

Love Will Tear Us Apart -- Joy Division
****************************************



When routine bites hard

and ambitions are low.

And resentment rides high

but emotions won't grow.

And we're changing our ways

taking different roads.



Love, love will tear us apart again.

Love, love will tear us apart again.



Why is the bedroom so cold

turned away on your side?

Is my timing that flawed

our respect run so dry?

Yet there's still this appeal

that we've kept through our lives.



Love, love will tear us apart again.

Love, love will tear us apart again.



Do you cry out in your sleep,

all my failings expose?

Gets a taste in my mouth

as desperation takes hold.

Why is it something so good

just can't function no more?



Love, love will tear us apart again.

Love, love will tear us apart again.

Love, love will tear us apart again...

Desolation Row -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



They're selling postcards of the hanging 
They're painting the passports brown 
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors 
The circus is in town 
Here comes the blind commissioner 
They've got him in a trance 
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker 
The other is in his pants 
And the riot squad they're restless 
They need somewhere to go 
As lady and I look out tonight 
From desolation row 
 
Cinderella, she seems so easy 
&amp;quot;it takes one to know one,&amp;quot; she smiles 
And puts her hands in her back pockets 
Bette davis style 
And in comes romeo, he's moaning 
&amp;quot;you belong to me I believe&amp;quot; 
And someone says,&amp;quot; you're in the wrong place, my friend 
You better leave&amp;quot; 
And the only sound that's left 
After the ambulances go 
Is cinderella sweeping up 
On desolation row 
 
Now the moon is almost hidden 
The stars are beginning to hide 
The fortunetelling lady 
Has even taken all her things inside 
All except for cain and abel 
And the hunchback of notre dame 
Everybody is making love 
Or else expecting rain 
And the good samaritan, he's dressing 
He's getting ready for the show 
He's going to the carnival tonight 
On desolation row 
 
Now ophelia, she's 'neath the window 
For her I feel so afraid 
On her twenty-second birthday 
She already is an old maid 
 
To her, death is quite romantic 
She wears an iron vest 
Her profession's her religion 
Her sin is her lifelessness 
And though her eyes are fixed upon 
Noah's great rainbow 
She spends her time peeking 
Into desolation row 
 
Einstein, disguised as robin hood 
With his memories in a trunk 
Passed this way an hour ago 
With his friend, a jealous monk 
He looked so immaculately frightful 
As he bummed a cigarette 
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes 
And reciting the alphabet 
Now you would not think to look at him 
But he was famous long ago 
For playing the electric violin 
On desolation row 
 
Dr. filth, he keeps his world 
Inside of a leather cup 
But all his sexless patients 
They're trying to blow it up 
Now his nurse, some local loser 
She's in charge of the cyanide hole 
And she also keeps the cards that read 
&amp;quot;have mercy on his soul&amp;quot; 
They all play on penny whistles 
You can hear them blow 
If you lean your head out far enough 
From desolation row 
 
Across the street they've nailed the curtains 
They're getting ready for the feast 
The phantom of the opera 
A perfect image of a priest 
They're spoonfeeding casanova 
To get him to feel more assured 
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence 
After poisoning him with words 
 
And the phantom's shouting to skinny girls 
&amp;quot;get outa here if you don't know 
Casanova is just being punished for going 
To desolation row&amp;quot; 
 
Now at midnight all the agents 
And the superhuman crew 
Come out and round up everyone 
That knows more than they do 
Then they bring them to the factory 
Where the heart-attack machine 
Is strapped across their shoulders 
And then the kerosene 
Is brought down from the castles 
By insurance men who go 
Check to see that nobody is escaping 
To desolation row 
 
Praise be to nero's neptune 
The titanic sails at dawn 
And everybody's shouting 
&amp;quot;which side are you on? &amp;quot; 
And ezra pound and t. s. eliot 
Fighting in the captain's tower 
While calypso singers laugh at them 
And fishermen hold flowers 
Between the windows of the sea 
Where lovely mermaids flow 
And nobody has to think too much 
About desolation row 
 
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 
(about the time the door knob broke) 
When you asked how I was doing 
Was that some kind of joke?  
All these people that you mention 
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame 
I had to rearrange their faces 
And give them all another name 
Right now I can't read too good 
Don't send me no more letters no 
Not unless you mail them 
From desolation row

I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You) -- Aretha Franklin
****************************************



You're a no good heart breaker

You're a liar and you're a cheat

And I don't know why

I let you do these things to me

My friends keep telling me

That you ain't no good

But oh, they don't know

That I'd leave you if I could



I guess I'm uptight

And I'm stuck like glue

Cause I ain't never

I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no (loved a man)

(The way that I, I love you)



Some time ago I thought

You had run out of fools

But I was so wrong

You got one that you'll never lose

The way you treat me is a shame

How could ya hurt me so bad

Baby, you know that I'm the best thing

That you ever had

Kiss me once again



Don'cha never, never say that we we're through

Cause I ain't never

Never, Never, no, no (loved a man)

(The way that I, I love you)



I can't sleep at night

And I can't EAT A BITE

I guess I'll never be free

Since you got, your hooks, in me



Whoa, oh, oh

Yeah! Yeah!

I ain't never loved a man

I ain't never loved a man, baby

Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad



No

Well this is what I'm gonna do about it

Who'll Stop The Rain -- Creedence Clearwater Revival
****************************************



Long as I remember the rain been comin' down 

Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground. 

Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun. 

And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain. 



I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm 

Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow 

Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains. 

And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain. 



Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more. 

The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm. 

Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears 

And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

****************************************



Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk, 
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk. 
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around 
since I was born. 
And now it's all right. It's OK. 
And you may look the other way. 
We can try to understand 
the New York Times' effect on man. 

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, 
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Feel the city bakin' and everybody shakin', 
and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive. 

Well now, I get low and I get high, 
and if I can't get either, I really try. 
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes. 
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose. 
You know it's all right. It's OK. 
I'll live to see another day. 
We can try to understand 
the New York Times' effect on man. 

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, 
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Feel the city bakin' and everybody shakin', 
and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive. 

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me. 
Somebody help me, yeah. 
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me. 
Somebody help me, yeah. Stayin' alive.

Free Bird -- Lynyrd Skynyrd
****************************************



If I leave here tomorrow 

Would you still remember me? 

For I must be travelling on, now, 

'Cause there's too many places I've got to see. 

But, if I stayed here with you, girl, 

Things just couldn't be the same. 

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now, 

And this bird you can not change. 

Lord knows, I can't change.



Bye, bye, its been a sweet love. 

Though this feeling I can't change. 

But please don't take it badly, 

'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame. 

But, if I stayed here with you girl, 

Things just couldn't be the same. 

Cause I'm as free as a bird now, 

And this bird you'll never change. 

And this bird you can not change. 

Lord knows, I can't change. 

Lord help me, I can't change.

I am a lineman for the county.

And I drive the mainroad.

Lookin' in the sun for another overload.



I hear you singing in the wire. Chorus 1

I can hear you thru the whine.

And the Wichita Lineman, 

is still on the line.



I know I need a small vacation.

But it don't look like rain.

And if it snows that stretch down south,

won't ever stand the strain.



And I need you more than want you. Chorus 2

And I want you for all time.

And the Wichita Lineman, 

is still on the line.

Maybe, if I pray every night

You'll come back to me.

Maybe, if I cry everyday

You'll come bavk to stay.

Ohhhh, maybe...



Maybe, if I hold your hand,

You will understand,

And maybe, if I kissed your lips

You'll be at my command.

Ohhhh, maybe...



I've prayed and prayed

To the Lord

To send you back my love,

But instead youcame to me

Only in My dreams



Maybe if I pray every night,

You'll come back to me.

Maybe If I cry every day,

You'll come back to stay.

Ohhhh, maybe.

Sweet Child O' Mine -- Guns 'N Roses
****************************************



She's got a smile that it seems to me 

Reminds me of childhood memories 

Where everything 

Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 

Now and then when I see her face 

She takes me away to that 

special place 

And if I stared too long 

I'd probably break down and cry 



Sweet child o' mine 

Sweet love of mine 



She's got eyes of the bluest skies 

As if they thought of rain 

I hate to look into those eyes 

And see an ounce of pain 

Her hair reminds me 

of a warm safe place 

Where as a child I'd hide 

And pray for the thunder 

And the rain 

To quietly pass me by 



Sweet child o' mine 

Sweet love of mine 



Where do we go 

Where do we go now 

Where do we go 

Sweet child o' mine

Don't Be Cruel -- Elvis Presley

You know I can be found,

sitting home all alone,

If you can't come around, 

at least please telephone.

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.



Baby, if I made you mad 

for something I might have said,

Please, let's forget the past, 

the future looks bright ahead,

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

I don't want no other love,

Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.



Don't stop thinking of me, 

don't make me feel this way,

Come on over here and love me, 

you know what I want you to say.

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

Why should we be apart?

I really love you baby, cross my heart.



Let's walk up to the preacher 

and let us say I do,

Then you'll know you'll have me, 

and I'll know that I'll have you,

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

I don't want no other love,

Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.



Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

I don't want no other love,

Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.

Loser -- Beck
****************************************



In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey

Butane in my veins so I'm out to cut the junkie

With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables

Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral

Stock car flamin with a loser and the cruise control

Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D

Got a couple of couches sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps sayin I'm insane to complain

About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

Don't believe everything that you breathe

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark

Savin all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park 

Yo cut it



Soy un perdedor

I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Double-barrel buckshot



Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare

Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber 

'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag

One's got on the pole shove the other in a bag

With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job

The daytime crap with the folksinger slop

He hung himself with a guitar string

Slap the turkey neck and it's hangin on a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate

Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate

And my time is a piece of wax fallin on a termite

Who's chokin on the splinters



Soy un perdedor

I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?

Get crazy with the Cheeze Whiz

Soy un perdidor

I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?

Drive-by body pierce

Yo bring it on down

Soy



I'm a driver I'm a winner things are gonna change I can feel it

I can't believe you



Sprechen sie Deutches, baby



Know what I'm sayin?

Bizarre Love Triangle -- New Order
****************************************



Every time I think of you

I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue

It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find

Living a life that I can't leave behind

But there's no sense in telling me

The wisdom of the fool won't set you free

But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows

Well every day my confusion grows



Every time I see you falling

I get down on my knees and pray

I'm waiting for that final moment

You say the words that I can't say



I feel fine and I feel good

I'm feeling like I never should

Whenever I get this way I just don't know what to say

Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday



I'm not sure what this could mean

I don't think you're what you seem

I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else

Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be



Every time I see you falling

I get down on my knees and pray

I'm waiting for that final moment

You say the words that I can't say

Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger he shoot coca-cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me

He bag production he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me

He roller-coaster he got early warning
He got muddy water he one mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now over me!

you've gotta lotta nerve to say you are my friend
when i was down you just stood there grinnin'
you've gotta lotta nerve to say you have a helping hand to lend
you just want to be on the side that's winnin'

you see me on the street, you always act surprised
ya say "how are you?", "good luck", but ya dont mean it
when you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralized
why dont you just come out once and scream it

i know the reason you talked behind my back
i used to be among the crowd you're in with
but do you take me for such a fool, to think i'd make contact
with the one who tries to hide what he dont know to begin with?

you say i've let you down - ya know its not like that
if you're so hurt, why then doncha show it?
you say you've lost your faith, but thats not where its at
ya have no faith to lose - an' ya know it

no, i doe not feel that good when i see the heartbreaks you embrace
if i was a master thief perhaps i'd rob them
and tho i know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
dont you understand, its not my problem?

i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
and just for that one moment i could be you
yes, i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
you'd know what a drag it is to see you

But before I'll let that happen

I'll dance my life away



They say two thousand zero zero party over

Oops out of time

Rockin' In The Free World -- Neil Young
****************************************



See the colors on the street

Red, White and Blue

People shufflin' their feet

People sleepin' in their shoes

There's a warnin' sign on the road ahead

There's a lotta people sayin' we'd be better off dead

Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them

So I try to forget it any way I can.



Keep on rockin' in the Free World...(x4)



I see a girl in the night

With a baby in her hands

Under an old street light

Near a garbage can

Now she puts her kid away, she's gonna get a hit

She hates her life for what she's done to it

That's one mre kid that'll never go to school,

never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.



Keep on rockin' in the Free World...(x4)



There's a thousand points of light

For the homeless man

There's an kinder, gentler machine-gun hand

I see a band and a people trying to keep hope alive

We got fuel to burn, got roads to drive. 



Keep on rockin' in the Free World...

Do You Believe In Magic -- The Lovin' Spoonful
****************************************



Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart

How the music can free her, whenever it starts

And it's magic, if the music is groovy

It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie

I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul

But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll



If you believe in magic don't bother to choose

If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues

Just go and listen it'll start with a smile

It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try

Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find

How you got there, so just blow your mind



If you believe in magic, come along with me

We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me

And maybe, if the music is right

I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night

And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see

How the magic's in the music and the music's in me



Yeah, do you believe in magic

Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul

Believe in the magic of rock and roll

Believe in the magic that can set you free

Ohh, talking 'bout magic



Do you believe like I believe	Do you believe in magic

Do you believe like I believe	Do you believe, believer

Do you believe like I believe	Do you believe in magic

Just walk away, Renee

You're not to blame 



From deep inside the tears that I'm forced to cry 

From deep inside the pain that I chose to hide

Just walk away, Renee 

You won't see me follow you back home 

Now, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes, 

For me, it cries

Still finds a way to haunt me though they're so small

Walk On The Wild Side -- Lou Reed
****************************************



Holly came from Miami, Fla 

Hitchhiked her way across the USA. 

Plucked her eyebrows on the way 

Shaved her leg and then he was she - she said: 



Hey Babe, take a walk on the wild side, 

Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side. 



Candy came from out on the island, 

In the backroom she was everybodys darling, 

But she never lost her head 

Even when she was given head - she said 



Hey Babe, take a walk on the wild side, 

Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side. 

And the coloured girls go, doo dodoo 



Little Joe never once gave it away, 

Ev'rybody had to pay and pay. 

A hustle here and a hustle there 

New York city is no place where they said: 



Hey Babe, take a walk on the wild side, 

Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side. 



Sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets 

Looking for soul food and a place to eat 

Went to the Apollo, you should have seen him go go go - they said: 



Hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side, 

Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side. 



Jackie is just speeding away, 

Thought she was James Dean for a day 

Then I guess she had to crash, Valium would have helped that bash - she said: 



Hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side, 

Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side. 

And the coloured girls go, doo dodoo

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again

Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate
You silly fool, you can't change your fate
Let's cug the rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates, roller-skates

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times

The hoochie coochie man

But you know I'm him

Everybody knows I'm him

Oh you know I'm the hoochie coochie man

Everybody knows I'm him

On the seventh day

On the seventh month

The seven doctors say

He was born for good luck

And that you'll see

Everybody knows I'm him

Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man

Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance

With the stars up above in your eyes

A fantabulous night to make romance

'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are falling

To the sound of the breezes that blow

And I'm trying to please to the calling

Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

You know the night's magic

Seems to whisper and hush

And all the soft moonlight

Seems to shine in your blush...



Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love?

Can I just make some more romance with a' you, my love?



Well I wanna make love to you tonight

I can't wait till the morning has come

And I know now the time is just right

And straight into my arms you will run

And when you come my heart will be waiting

To make sure that you're never alone

There and then all my dreams will come true dear

There and then I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside

And I know how much you want me that, you can't hide...



Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love?

Can I just make some more romance with a' you, my love?



Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance

With the stars up above in your eyes

A fantabulous night to make romance

And I'm trying to please to the calling

Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

One more moondance with you

In the moonlight

On a magic night

On a magic night

Can't I just have one more dance

With you my love?

Fire And Rain -- James Taylor
****************************************



Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone 

Susanne the plans they made put an end to you 

I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song 

I just can't remember who to send it to 



I've seen fire and I've seen rain 

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 

But I always thought that I'd see you again 



Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 

You've got to help me make a stand 

You've just got to see me through another day 

My body's aching and my time is at hand 

And I won't make it any other way 



Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 

But I always thought that I'd see you again 



Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun 

Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around 

Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things 

to come 

Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground 



Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 

But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now 



Thought I'd see you one more time again 

There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now 

Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now

Just Like A Woman -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Nobody feels any pain

Tonight as I stand inside the rain

Ev'rybody knows

That Baby's got new clothes

But lately I see her ribbons and her bows

Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman, yes, she does

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does

And she aches just like a woman

But she breaks just like a little girl.



Queen Mary, she's my friend

Yes, I believe I'll go see her again

Nobody has to guess 

That Baby can't be blessed

Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest

With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.

She takes just like a woman, yes, she does

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does

And she aches just like a woman

But she breaks just like a little girl.



It was raining from the first

And I was dying there of thirst

So I came in here

And your long-time curse hurts

But what's worse

Is this pain in here

I can't stay in here

Ain't it clear that⁄FFFFD1



I just can't fit

Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit

When we meet again

Introduced as friends

Please don't let on that you knew me when

I was hungry and it was your world.

Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do

You make love just like a woman, yes, you do

Then you ache just like a woman

But you break just like a little girl.

Ooh, now let's get down tonight

Baby I'm hot just like an oven

I need some lovin'

And baby, I can't hold it much longer

It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling

I want Sexual Healing

Sexual Healing, oh baby

Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind

Sexual Healing baby, is good for me

Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue tear drops are falling

And my emotional stability is leaving me

There is something I can do

I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and

Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me

The love you give to me will free me

If you don't know the things you're dealing

I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing

Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, let's make love tonight

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 'cos you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning

A sea was storming inside of me

Baby I think I'm capsizing

The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling

I want Sexual Healing

Sexual Healing is good for me

Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush

Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual Healing, baby, is good for me

Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me and it's good to me

My baby ohhh

Come take control, just grab a hold

Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it

Honey, oh we're feeling fine

You're my medicine open up and let me in

Darling, you're so great

I can't wait for you to operate

I can't wait for you to operate

When I get this feeling, I need Sexual Healing (ad lib)

Only the lonely 

Know the heartaches I've been through 

Only the lonely 

Know I cried and cried for you 



Maybe tomorrow 

A new romance 

No more sorrow 

But that's the chance - You gotta take 

If your lonely heart breaks 

Only the lonely 



Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah

I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better -- The Byrds
****************************************



The reason why, oh, I can say

I have to let you go, babe, and right away

After what you did I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone



Baby, for a long time you had me believe

That your love was all mine and that's the way it would be

But I didn't know that you were putting me on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

When you're gone



Now, I've got to say that it's not like before

And I'm not gonna play your games any more

After what you did I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

Oh, when you're gone, oh, when you're gone

Oh, when you're gone

I Fall To Pieces -- Patsy Cline
****************************************



I Fall to pieces
each time I see you again 
I fall to pieces 
How can I be just you're friend 
You want me to act like we¥ve never kissed 
You want me to forget
pretend we¥ve never met 
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet,
You walk bye and I fall to pieces 
I fall to pieces 
each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame 
You tell me to find someone else to love Someone who'll love me too
the way you used to do. 
But each time I go out with someone new you walk bye and I fall to pieces 
you walk bye and I fall to pieces

Where pretty girls are will you know that I'm around
I kiss'em and I love'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug'em and I squeeze'em they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer - yeah -the wanderer

Oh, well there's Flo on my left arm and there's Marry on my right
And Jenny's the girl with that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I'll tear open my shirt and show her Rosie on my chest
'Cause I'm the wanderer - yeah -the wanderer
I roam around around around around

Oh, well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
And with my two fists of iron but I'm going no way on

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself fallin' for some girl
I hope right into that car of mine I drive around the world
Yeah I'm a wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around around
Lettin' go

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself fallin' for some girl
I hope right into that car of mine drive around the world
'Cause I'm a wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around around around around
'Cause I'm a wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around around around around around
'Cause I'm a wanderer I'm a wanderer

Son Of A Preacher Man -- Dusty Springfield
****************************************



Billy-Ray was a preacher's son

And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

When they gathered round and started talkin'

That's when Billy would take me walkin'

A-through the back yard we'd go walkin'

Then he'd look into my eyes

Lord knows to my surprise



The only one who could ever reach me

Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me

Was the son of a preacher man

Yes he was, he was, mmm, yes he was



Being good isn't always easy

No matter how hard I try

When he started sweet-talkin' to me

He'd come and tell me everything is all right

He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right

Can I get away again tonight?



The only one who could ever reach me

Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me

Was the son of a preacher man

Yes he was, he was, Lord knows he was



How well I remember

The look that was in his eyes

Stealin' kisses from me on the sly

Takin' time to make time

Tellin' me that he's all mine

Learnin' from each other's knowing

Lookin' to see how much we've grown



And the only one who could ever reach me

Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me

Was the son of a preacher man

Yes he was, he was, oh, yes he was

He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man

I guessed he was the son of a preacher man

Sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man

Ahh, move me

Stand 

In the end you'll still be you 

One that's done all the things you set out to do 

Stand 

There's a cross for you to bear 

Things to go through if you're going anywhere 

Stand 

For the things you know are right 

It s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight 

Stand 

All the things you want are real 

You have you to complete and there is no deal 

Stand. stand, stand 

Stand. stand, stand 

Stand 

You've been sitting much too long 

There's a permanent crease in your right and wrong 

Stand 

There's a midget standing tall 

And the giant beside him about to fall 

Stand. stand, stand 

Stand. stand, stand 

Stand 

They will try to make you crawl 

And they know what you're saying makes sense and all 

Stand 

Don't you know that you are free 

Well at least in your mind if you want to be 



Everybody 

Stand, stand, stand

Music by elton john 
Lyrics by bernie taupin 
Available on the album honky ch‚teau 
 
She packed my bags last night pre-flight 
Zero hour nine a.m. 
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then 
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife 
It's lonely out in space 
On such a timeless flight 
 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time 
Till touch down brings me round again to find 
I'm not the man they think I am at home 
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man 
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone 
 
 
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids 
In fact it's cold as hell 
And there's no one there to raise them if you did 
And all this science I don't understand 
It's just my job five days a week 
A rocket man, a rocket man 
 
 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time...

If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says

15 miles to the... Love Shack! Love Shack yeah

I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway, 

lookin' for the love getaway

Heading for the love getaway, love getaway,

I got me a car, it's as big as a whale 

and we're headin' on down

To the Love Shack

I got me a Chrysler, it seats about 20

So hurry up and bring your jukebox money



The Love Shack is a little old place 

where we can get together

Love Shack baby, Love Shack bay-bee.

Love baby, that's where it's at, 

Ooo love baby, that's where it's at



Sign says.. Woo... stay away fools, 

'cause love rules at the Lo-o-ove Shack!

Well it's set way back in the middle of a field,

Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back



Glitter on the mattress

Glitter on the highway

Glitter on the front porch

Glitter on the hallway



The Love Shack is a little old place 

where we can get together

Love Shack bay-bee!  Love Shack baby!

Love Shack, that's where it's at!

Huggin' and a kissin', dancin' and a lovin', 

wearin' next to nothing

Cause it's hot as an oven

The whole shack shimmies! 

The whole shack shimmies when everybody's

Movin' around and around and around and around!

Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby!

Folks linin' up outside just to get down

Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby

Funky little shack!  Funk-y little shack!



Hop in my Chrysler,

it's as big as a whale 

and it's about to set sail!

I got me a car, it seats about twenty

So c'mon and bring your jukebox money.



The Love Shack is a little old place 

where we can get together

Love Shack baby!  Love Shack bay-bee!

(Love Shack...Love Shack...)

Love Shack, that's where it's at!



Bang bang bang on the door baby! 

Knock a little louder baby!

Bang bang bang on the door baby! 

I can't hear you

Bang bang on the door baby

Bang bang on the door

Bang bang on the door baby

Bang bang

You're what?... Tin roof, rusted!



Love Shack, baby Love Shack!

Love Shack, baby Love Shack!

Love baby, that's where it's at

Love Shack, baby Love Shack!

Love baby, that's where it's at

Huggin' and a kissin',

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down -- Band
****************************************



Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train,

'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again.

In the winter of '65, We were hungry, just barely alive.

By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well,



(Chorus)

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the bells were ringing,

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the people were singin'.  They went   

La,  La, La, La, La, La,     La, La, La, La, La, La,    La, La,



Back with my wife in Tennessee, When one day she called to me,

"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!"

Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good.

Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,

But they should never have taken the very best.     (Chorus)



Like my father before me, I will work the land,

Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.

He was just eighteen, proud and brave,  But a Yankee laid him in his grave,

I swear by the mud below my feet, 

You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat.    (Chorus and fade)

And these reasons i'll tell ya why
Ya see i'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
And I dress to a T
Ya see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a Sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool,
which really is on the wall
I got a color tv so I can see
the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin bout checkbooks, credit cards
More money, a than a sucker could ever spend
but i wouldnt give a sucker or a bum from the rucker
Not a dime til i made it again
Everybody go
Ya go hotel motel
Whatcha gonna do today (Say what?)
Cuz I'm gon get a fly girl gonna get some spankin
Drive off in a def oj
Everybody go, hotel, motel Holiday Inn
Ya see if your girl starts actin up, then you take her friend
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
Its on you so what you gonna do?

Well it's on n n on n on on n on
The beat dont stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, a t-e-r, a G with a double e
I said i go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
by all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest brother that ever could be
Now I'm feelin the highs and ya feelin the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin ya fingers and stompin your feet
And movin your body while youre sittin' in your seat
And the damn ya start doin the freak
I said damn, a right a outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
ya rockin to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin to the beat without a care
with the sureshot M.C.s for the affair
now, im not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eye
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat dont stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
pop da pop pop ya dont dare stop

I guess by now you can take a hunch
and find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind
Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat dont stop until the break of dawn
A singin' on n n on n on on n on

i said i cant wait til the end of the week
when im rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
and attempt to raise your body heat
just blow your mind so that you cant speak
and do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
and let it change up to a dance called the freak
and when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
rest a little while so ya dont get weak
i know a man named hank
he has more rhymes than a serious bank
so come on hank sing that song
to the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

well, im imp the dimp the ladies pimp
the women fight for my delight
but im the grandmaster with the three mcs
that shock the house for the young ladies
and when you come inside, into the front
you do the freak, spank, and do the bump
and when the sucker mcs try to prove a point

we're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
a from sun to sun and from day to day
i sit down and write a brand new rhyme
because they say that miracles never cease
i've created a devastating masterpiece
i'm gonna rock the mike til you cant resist
everybody, i say it goes like this
well i was comin home late one dark afternoon
a reporter stopped me for a interview
she said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
that i'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
this young reporter i did adore
so i rocked a vicious rhyme like i never did before
she said damn fly guy im in love with you
the casanova legend must have been true
i said by the way baby what's your name
said i go by the name of lois lane
and you could be my boyfiend you surely can
just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
i said he's a fairy i do suppoose
flyin through the air in pantyhose
he may be very sexy or even cute
but he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
i said you need a man who's got finesse
and his whole name across his chest
he may be able to fly all through the night
but can he rock a party til the early light
he cant satisfy you with his little worm
but i can bust you out with my super sperm
i go do it, i go do it, i go do it, do it , do it
an i'm here an i'm there i'm big bang hank, im everywhere

everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
you say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
i say skip, dive, what can i say
i cant fit em all inside my oj
so i just take half and bust them out
i give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house 
it was twelve o'clock one friday night
i was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
everybody was dancin on the floor
doin all the things they never did before
and then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
she came into the bar, she came into the scene
as she traveled deeper inside the room
all the fellas checked out her white sasoons
she came up to the table, looked into my eyes
then she turned around and shook her behind
so i said to myself, its time for me to release
my vicious rhyme i call my masterpiece
and now people in the house this is just for you
a little rap to make you boogaloo
now the group ya hear is called phase two
and let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
once a week we're on the street
just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
for you to party ya got to have the movies
so we'll get right down and give you the groove
for you to dance you gotta get hype
so we'll get right down for you tonight
now the system's on and the girls are there
ya definitely have a rockin affair
but let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
that to have a party ya got to have a rap
so when the party's over you're makin it home
and tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
and while ya sleepin ya start to dream
and thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
my name appears in your mind
yeah, a name you know that was right on time
it was phase two just a doin a do
rockin ya down cause ya know we could
to the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
come alive girls get on your feet

to the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
on n on into the break of dawn
now i got a man comin on right now
he's guaranteed to throw down
he goes by the name of wonder mike
come on wonder mike do what ya like

like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
like a millionaire that has no money
like a rainy day that is not wet
like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
like dracula with out his fangs

like collard greens that dont taste good
like a tree that's not made out of wood
like goin up and not comin down
is just like the beat without the sound no sound
to the beat beat, ya do the freak
everybody just rock and dance to the beat
have you ever went over a friends house to eat
and the food just aint no good
i mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
and the chicken tastes like wood
so you try to play it off like you think you can
by sayin that youre full
and then your friend says momma he's just being polite
he aint finished uh uh that's bull
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate
and your friend says man there's plenty of food
so you pile some more on your plate
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
of the moment that it's time to leave
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
into something that looks like cheese
oh so you say that's it i got to leave this place
i dont care what these people think
im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks
so you bust out the door while its still closed
still sick from the food you ate
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate
and then you call your friend two weeks later
to see how he has been
and he says i understand about the food
baby bubbah but we're still friends
with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie

he said sit down punk i wanna talk to you
and dont say a word until i'm through
now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
a time to live and a time to die
a time to break and a time to chill
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever ya do in your lifetime
ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
so from sixty six til this very day
ill always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
i let them know that i'm versatile
i got style finesse and a little black book
that's filled with rhymes and i know you wanna look
but there's a thing that separates you from me
and that's called originality
because my rhymes are on from what you heard

Paranoid -- Black Sabbath
****************************************



Finished with my woman

'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind

People think I'm insane

Because I am frowning all the time



All day long I think of things

But nothing seems to satisfy

Think I'll lose my mind

If I don't find something to pacify



Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah!



I need someone to show me

The things in life that I can't find

I can't see the things that make true happiness

I must be blind



Make a joke and I will sigh

And you will laugh and I will cry

Happiness I cannot feel

And love to me is so unreal



And so as you hear these words

Telling you now of my state

I tell you to enjoy life

I wish I could but it's too late

Now that Macky's back in town.....

Money Honey -- The Drifters
****************************************



You know, the landlord rang my front door bell-- 

I let it ring for a long, long spell-- 

I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind, 

And asked him to tell me what was on his mind. 

He said, "Money, honey! 

Money, honey! 

Money, honey, 

If you wanna get along with me." 



I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed-- 

I called the woman that I love the best-- 

I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three-- 

She said, "I'd like to know what you want with me." 

I said, "Money, honey! 

Money, honey! 

Money, honey, 

If you wanna get along with me." 



She screamed and said, "What's wrong with you? 

From this day on, our romance is through." 

I said, "Tell me, baby, face to face-- 

A-how could another man take my place?" 

She said, "Money, honey! 

Money, honey! 

Money, honey, 

If you wanna get along with me." 



Well, I learned my lesson and now I know-- 

The sun may shine and the wind may blow-- 

Women may come, and the women may go, 

But before I say I love 'em so, 

I want-- money, honey! 

Money, honey! 

Money, honey, 

If you wanna get along with me. 

(If you wanna get along) Well, make some money 

(If you wanna get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey 

(If you wanna get along) You better give up some money 

If you wanna get along with me

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find much o' mistrust

Love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine

Soon found out I was losing my mind

It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind

Much o' mistrust

Love's gone behind

In between what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine

Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind

If I fear I'm losing you

It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find much o' mistrust

Love's gone behind

Lost inside

Adorable illusion and I cannot hide

I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside

We coulda made it cruising yeah

La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La La

La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La La

Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

Seemed like the real thing only to find much o' mistrust

Love's gone behind

Hallelujah -- Jeff Buckley
****************************************



i heard there was a secret chord

that david played and it pleased the lord

but you don't really care for music, do you

well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth

the minor fall and the major lift

the baffled king composing hallelujah



hallelujah... 



well your faith was strong but you needed proof

you saw her bathing on the roof

her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

she tied you to her kitchen chair

she broke your throne and she cut your hair

and from your lips she drew the hallelujah



hallelujah...



baby i've been here before

i've seen this room and i've walked this floor

i used to live alone before i knew you

i've seen your flag on the marble arch

but love is not a victory march

it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah



hallelujah...



well there was a time when you let me know

what's really going on below

but now you never show that to me do you

but remember when i moved in you

and the holy dove was moving too

and every breath we drew was hallelujah



well, maybe there's a god above

but all i've ever learned from love

was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

it's not a cry that you hear at night

it's not somebody who's seen the light

it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah



hallelujah...

He's a Rebel -- The Crystals

See the way he walks down the street

Watch the way he shuffles his feet

My, he holds his head up high

When he goes walking by

He's my guy



When he holds my hand, I'm so proud

'Cause he's not just one of the crowd

Why is he always the one

To try the things they've never done?

And just because of that, they say:



"He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good

He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should"

But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does,

That's no reason why I can't give him all my love

He's always good to me,

Always treats me tenderly

'Cause he's not a rebel, no no no

He's not a rebel, no no no, to me



INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE



If they don't like him that way,

They won't like me, I'm sure, today

And I'll be standing right by his side when they say:



"He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good

He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should"

But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does,

That's no reason why we can't share love

He's always good to me

Good to him, I try to be

'Cause he's not a rebel, no no no

He's not a rebel, no no no, to me

Oh! (he's not a rebel, no no no)



He's not a rebel, no no no

Walking In The Rain -- Ronettes
****************************************



Writer:  Phil Spector, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil
I want him, and I need him,
And someday someway wooo I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do..
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
When he's near me, I'll kiss him,
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care
And I'll know it's gonna be alright cause we've got so much we share
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
(Johnny) no no he'll never do
(Bobby) no it isn't him too
They would never no they'd never never ever love
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love
Oh Oh Oh Where can he be oh oh (fade)

Personality Crisis -- New York Dolls
****************************************



Personality crisis 
 
Well we can't take it this week 
And her friends don't want another speach 
Hoping for a better day to hear what she's got to say 
 
All about that 
Personality crisis you got it while it was hot 
But now frustration and heartache is what you got 
(that's why they talk about personality) 
 
But now your tryin to be some no you got to do some 
Wanna be someone who cow wow wows 
But you think about the times you did they took every ounce 
When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout 
You got to contradict all those times you were butterflyin about 
 
(you were butterflyin) 
All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot 
But now frustration and heartache is what you got 
°∫break°∫ 
 
And your a prima ballerina on a spring afternoon 
Change on into the wolfman howlin at the moon hooowww 
 
All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot 
But now frustration and heartache is what you got 
 
Now with all the crossin fingers that mother nature says 
Your mirrors get jammed up with all your friends 
 
That personality everything starts to blend 
Personality when your mind starts to blend 
Personality impression of a friend, 
Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend 
Personality wonderin how celebrities ever met 
(look and find out on television) 
 
Personality crisis you got it while it was hot 
Frustration and heartache is all you got, don't you worry 
Personality crisis please don't cry 
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop 
 
Because you walk a personality 
Talk a personality

Sunday Bloody Sunday -- U2
****************************************



Yes...

I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes
And make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...tonight...

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On...

Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday...

Roadrunner, roadrunner

Going faster miles an hour

Gonna drive past the Stop 'n' Shop

With the radio on



I'm in love with Massachusetts

And the neon when it's cold outside

And the highway when it's late at night

Got the radio on

I'm like the roadrunner





Alright

I'm in love with modern moonlight

128 when it's dark outside

I'm in love with Massachusetts

I'm in love with the radio on

It helps me from being alone late at night

It helps me from being lonely late at night

I don't feel so bad now in the car

Don't feel so alone, got the radio on

Like the roadrunner

That's right





Said welcome to the spirit of 1956

Patient in the bushes next to '57

The highway is your girlfriend as you go by quick

Suburban trees, suburban speed

And it smells like heaven(thunder)

And I say roadrunner once

Roadrunner twice

I'm in love with rock &amp; roll and I'll be out all night

Roadrunner

That's right





Well now

Roadrunner, roadrunner

Going faster miles an hour

Gonna drive to the Stop 'n' Shop

With the radio on at night

And me in love with modern moonlight

Me in love with modern rock &amp; roll

Modern girls and modern rock &amp; roll

Don't feel so alone, got the radio on

Like the roadrunner

O.K., now you sing Modern Lovers

Got the car, got the AM

Got the, late at night, (?), rock &amp; roll late at night

The factories and the auto signs got the power of modern sounds

Alright

He Stopped Loving Her Today -- George Jones
****************************************



He said I'll love you 'til I die 

she told him you'll forget in time 

And as the years went slowly by 

she still preyed upon his mind 

He kept her picture on his wall 

went half crazy now and then 

he still loved her through it all 

Hoping she'd come back again 



Kept some letters by his bed 

Dated 1962 

He had underlined in red 

every single I Love You 

I went to see him just today 

Oh, but I didn't see no tears 

All dressed up to go away 

First time I'd seen him smile in years 



Chorus: 

He Stopped loving her today 

they placed a wreath upon his door 

and soon they'll carry him away 

He stopped loving her today 



Spoken: 

You know, she came to see him one last time 

Ohh, and we all wondered if she would 

and it kept running through my mind 

this time, he's over her for good 



Repeat Chorus 



And soon they'll carry him away 

He stopped loving her today

We come on the sloop John B 

My grandfather and me 

Around Nassau town we did roam 

Drinking all night 

Got into a fight 

Well I feel so broke up 

I want to go home 



So hoist up the John B's sail 

See how the mainsail sets 

Call for the Captain ashore 

Let me go home, let me go home 

I wanna go home, yeah yeah 

Well I feel so broke up 

I wanna go home 



The first mate he got drunk 

And broke in the Cap'n's trunk 

The constable had to come and take him away 

Sheriff John Stone 

Why don't you leave me alone, yeah yeah 

Well I feel so broke up I wanna go home 



So hoist up the John B's sail 

See how the mainsail sets 

Call for the Captain ashore 

Let me go home, let me go home 

I wanna go home, let me go home 

Why don't you let me go home

Hoist up the John B 

I feel so broke up I wanna go home 

Let me go home 



The poor cook he caught the fits 

And threw away all my grits 

And then he took and he ate up all of my corn 

Let me go home 

Why don't they let me go home 

This is the worst trip I've ever been on 



So hoist up the John B's sail 

See how the mainsail sets 

Call for the Captain ashore 

Let me go home, let me go home 

I wanna go home, let me go home 

Why don't you let me go home

Something in the way she moves

Attracts me like no other lover

Something in the way she woos me



I don't want to leave her now

You know I believe her now



Somewhere in her smile she knows

That I don't need no other lover

Something in her style that shows me



Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe her now



You're asking me will my love grow

I don't know, I don't know

You stick around now it may show

I don't know, I don't know



Something in the way she knows

And all I have to do is think of her

Something in the things she shows me



Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe her now

Somebody To Love -- Jefferson Airplane

When the truth is found to be lies 
And all the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love. 

When the morning flowers, baby are dead,yes.
And your mind,(your mind) is so full of bread. 
Don't you want somebody to love? 
Don't you need somebody to love? 
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love. 

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his,
Yeah, but in your head, baby,I'm afraid you don't know where it is.
Don't you want somebody to love? 
Don't you need somebody to love? 
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.

Tears are running, yeah running down your vest.
And your friends, baby,They treat you like a guest.
Don't you want somebody to love? 
Don't you need somebody to love? 
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.

Born In The U.S.A. -- Bruce Springsteen
****************************************



Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering upBorn in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Got in a little hometown jam so they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land to go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says "son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said "son don't you understand now"
Had a brother at Khe Sahn fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.

Ziggy Stardust -- David Bowie
****************************************



Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly

The spiders from Mars.  He played it left hand 

But made it too far

Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band



Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo

Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling

He could leave 'em to hang

Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.



So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls

Just the beer light to guide us,

So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?



Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo

The kids were just crass, he was the nazz

With God given ass

He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar



Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind

Like a leper messiah

When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.



Oh yeah 

Ooooooo

Ziggy played guitaarrrrrr

Pictures Of You -- The Cure
****************************************



i've been looking so long at these pictures of

you that i almost belive that they're real i've

been living so long with my pictures of you that

i almost believe that the pictures are all i can

feel



remembering you standing quiet in the rain as

i ran to your heart to be near and we kissed as

the sky fell in holding you close how i always

held close in your fear remembering you

running soft through the night you were bigger

and brighter than the snow and

screamed at the make-believe screamed at the

sky and you finally found all your courage to

let it all go



remembering you fallen into my arms crying

for the death of your heart you were stone

white so delicate lost in the cold you were

always so lost in the dark remembering you

how you used to be slow drowned you were

angels so much more than everything oh hold

for the last time then slip away quietly open

my eyes but i never see anything



if only i had thought of the right words i could

have hold on to your heart if only i'd thought of

the right words i wouldn't be breaking apart all

my pictures of you



Looking So long at these pictures of you but i

never hold on to your heart looking so long for

the words to be true but always just breaking

apart my pictures of you



there was nothing in the world that i ever

wanted more than to feel you deep in my heart

there was nothing in the world that i ever

wanted more than to never feel the breaking

apart all my pictures of you

Ain't No Sunshine -- Bill Withers

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone. 

It's not warm when she's away. 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away. 



Wonder this time where she's gone, 

Wonder if she's gone to stay 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away. 



And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 



Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone, 

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, only darkness everyday. 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, 

And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away. 



Anytime she goes away. 

Anytime she goes away. 

Anytime she goes away. 

Anytime she goes away.

Whoa whoa

That's why I'll always stay around 
You are the apple of my eye 
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely 
Because you came to my rescue 
And I know that this must be heaven 
How could so much love be inside of you

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,

You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart.

Help Me -- Joni Mitchell

Help me 
I think I'm falling 
In love again 
When I get that crazy feeling, I know 
I'm in trouble again 
I'm in trouble 
'cause you're a rambler and a gambler 
And a sweet-taiking-ladies man 
And you love your lovin' 
But not like you love your freedom 
 
Help me 
I think I'm falling 
In love too fast 
It's got me hoping for the future 
And worrying about the past 
'cause I've seen some hot hot blazes 
Come down to smoke and ash 
We love our lovin' 
But not like we love our freedom 
 
Didn't it feel good 
We were sitting there talking 
Or lying there not talking 
Didn't it feel good 
You dance with the lady 
With the hole in her stocking 
Didn't it feel good 
Didn't it feel good 
 
Help me 
I think I'm falling 
In love with you 
Are you going to let me go there by myself 
That's such a lonely thing to do 
Both of us flirting around 
Flirting and flirting 
Hurting too 
We love our lovin' 
But not like we love our freedom

As I walk through 
This wicked world 
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity. 
 
I ask myself 
Is all hope lost?  
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?  
 
And each time I feel like this inside, 
There's one thing I wanna know: 
What's so funny 'bout peace love &amp; understanding? ohhhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love &amp; understanding?  
 
And as I walked on 
Through troubled times 
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes 
So where are the strong 
And who are the trusted?  
And where is the harmony?  
Sweet harmony. 
 
'cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry. 
What's so funny 'bout peace love &amp; understanding? ohhhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love &amp; understanding?

Summer Babe -- Pavement

and she's eating her fingers
like they're just another meal
and she waits there in the levee wash
mixing cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar
my eyes stick to all those shiny robes
you wear on the protein delta strip
in an abandoned houseboat
I'll wait there, I'll be waiting forever
waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
minerals, ice deposits
daily drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things
I want to sell but not here babe, you took it all
everytime I sit around I find that I'm shocked
everytime I sit around I find that I'm shocked
everytime I sit around I find
everytime I sit around I find
everytime, everytime, everytime, everytime
you're my summer babe

Can't buy me love



I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright

I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright

I'll give you all I got to give if you say you love me too

I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you

I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love



Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so

Can't buy me love, no no no, no



Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied

Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy

I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

Stan -- Eminem
****************************************



Chorus: Dido

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

1st Chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background
2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after "thunder" noise

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

{Chorus: Dido}

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

{Chorus: Dido}

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; {*screaming*} Shut up bitch!  I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
{*car tires squeal*}  {*CRASH*}
.. {*brief silence*} .. {*LOUD splash*}

{Chorus: Dido}

[Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad?  Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!

Say you stand by your man

Tell me something I don't understand

You said you love me and that's a fact

Then you left me, said you felt trapped



Well some things you can explain away

But my heartache's in me till this day



Chorus

Did you stand by me

No, not at all

Did you stand by me

No way



All the times

When we were close

I'll remember these things the most

I see all my dreams come tumbling down

I won't be happy without you around



So all alone I keep the wolves at bay

There is only one thing that I can say



Chorus



You must explain why this must be

Did you lie when you spoke to me



Did you stand by me

No, not at all



Now I got a job

But it don't pay

I need new clothes

I need somewhere to stay

But without all these things I can do

But without your love I won't make it through



But you don't understand my point of view

I suppose there's nothing I can do



Chorus



You must explain why this must be

Did you lie when you spoke to me? 



Did you stand by me

Did you stand by me

No, not at all

Did you stand by me

No way

Did you stand by me

No, not at all

Did you stand by me

just as soon as you can.

People say that I've found a way,

to make you say,

that you love me.

But baby,

that I wanna come back,

show me where it's at, baby.



I'm so tired of being alone,

I'm so tired of on-my-own,

I guess you know that I, uh,

love you so,

even though,

you don't want me no more,

hey, hey, hey, I'm cryin' tears,

all through the years,

I tell you like it is,

honey, love me if you can.



Ya baby,

tired of being alone here by myself,

I tell ya, I'm tired baby,

I'm tired of being all wrapt up late at night,

in my dreams, nobody but you, baby.

Sometimes I wonder,

if you love me like you say you do,

You see baby, I've been thinking about you,

I've been wanting to get next to you, baby,

Sometimes I hold my arms and I say,

Mmmmm hmmmm hmmmm,

O baby, needing you has proven to me,

to be my greatest dream.



I'm so tired of being alone,

I'm so tired of on-my-own,

...Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby,

Baby, baby, ya...

Oh yeah 
In france a skinny man 
Died of a big disease with a little name 
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle 
And soon she did the same 
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys 
And their idea of fun 
Is being in a gang called the disciples 
High on crack, totin' a machine gun 
 
Time, time 
 
Hurricane annie ripped the ceiling of a church 
And killed everyone inside 
U turn on the telly and every other story 
Is tellin' u somebody died 
Sister killed her baby cuz she could afford 2 feed it 
And we're sending people 2 the moon 
In september my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time 
Now he's doing horse, it's june 
 
Times, times 
 
It's silly, no?  
When a rocket ship explodes 
And everybody still wants 2 fly 
Some say a man ain't happy 
Unless a man truly dies 
Oh why 
Time, time 
 
Baby make a speech, star wars fly 
Neighbors just shine it on 
But if a night falls and a bomb falls 
Will anybody see the dawn 
Time, times 
 
It's silly, no?  
When a rocket blows 
And everybody still wants 2 fly 
Some say a man ain't happy, truly 
Until a man truly dies 
Oh why, oh why, sign o the times 
 
Time, time 
 
Sign o the times mess with your mind 
Hurry before it's 2 late 
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby 
We'll call him nate... if it's a boy

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone

I hear you call my name

And it feels like home



Chorus:



When you call my name it's like a little prayer

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

In the midnight hour I can feel your power

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there



I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing

I have no choice, I hear your voice

Feels like flying

I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling

Out of the sky, I close my eyes

Heaven help me



(chorus)



Like a child you whisper softly to me

You're in control just like a child

Now I'm dancing

It's like a dream, no end and no beginning

You're here with me, it's like a dream

Let the choir sing



(chorus)



Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there

Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery

Just like a dream, you are not what you seem

Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there



Just like a prayer, I'll take you there

It's like a dream to me

Sugar

Sugar

mmm ... ooh



She sits alone waiting for suggestions

He's so nervous avoiding all her questions

His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding

Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?



If you want my body and you think I'm sexy

Come on, sugar, let me know

If you really need me just reach out and touch me

Come on, honey, tell me so



He's acting shy looking for an answer

Come on, honey, let's spend the night together

Now hold on a minute before we go much further

Give me a dime so I can phone my mother

They catch a cab to his high rise apartment

At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant



If you want my body and you think I'm sexy

Come on, sugar, let me know

If you really need me just reach out and touch me

Come on, honey, tell me so



His heart's beating like a drum

'Cause at last he's got his girl home

Relax, baby, now we are alone



[break]



They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing

Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking

Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining

They got each other, neither one's complaining

He say's I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee

Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie



If you want my body and you think I'm sexy

Come on, sugar, let me know

If you really need me just reach out and touch me

Come on, honey, tell me so

Tell me so, baby

Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain -- Willie Nelson

In the twilight glow I seen her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Yesterday don't matter if it's gone 

While the sun is bright 

Or in the darkest night 

No one knows 

She comes and goes 



Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 

Who could hang a name on you? 

When you change with every new day 

Still I'm gonna miss you... 



Don't question why she needs to be so free 

She'll tell you it's the only way to be 

She just can't be chained 

To a life where nothing's gained 

And nothing's lost 

At such a cost 



There's no time to lose, I heard her say 

Catch your dreams before they slip away 

Dying all the time 

Lose your dreams 

And you will lose your mind. 

Ain't life unkind? 



Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 

Who could hang a name on you? 

When you change with every new day 

Still I'm gonna miss you...

With A Little Help From My Friends -- Beatles
****************************************



What would you think if I sang out of tune,

Would you stand up and walk out on me ?

Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song

And I'll try not to sing out of key.



Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends

Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends

Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends



What do I do when my love is away

(Does it worry you to be alone ?)

How do I feel by the end of the day,

(Are you sad because you're on your own ?)



No, I get by with a little help from my friends

Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends

Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends



Do you need anybody

I need somebody to love

Could it be anybody

I want somebody to love.



Would you believe in a love at first sight

Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time

What do you see when you turn out the light

I can't tell you but I know it's mine,



Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends

Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends

Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends



Do you need anybody

I just need someone to love

Could it be anybody

I want somebody to love.



Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends

with a little help from my friends.

Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud -- James Brown
****************************************



Now we demand a chance to do things for ourserlf

We're tired of beatin' our head against the wall

And workin' for someone else

We're people, we're just like the birds and the bees

We'd rather die on our feet

Than be livin' on our knees

Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud..........

That's Entertainment -- The Jam
****************************************



A police car and a screaming siren -

A pnuematic drill and ripped up concrete -

A baby wailing and stray dog howling -

The screech of brakes and lamplights blinking -



that's entertainment.



that's entertainment.



A smash of glass and the rumble of boots -

An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth -

Paint spattered walls and the cry of a tomcat -

Lights going out and a kick in the balls -



I say that's entertainment.



that's entertainment.



Days of speed and slow time Mondays -

Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday -

Watching the news and not eating your tea -

A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls -



I say that's entertainment.



that's entertainment.



Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning -

Opening the windows and breathing in petrol -

An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard -

Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays - 



that's entertainment.



that's entertainment.



Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes -

Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume -

A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac -

Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway -



that's entertainment.



that's entertainment.



Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight -

Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude -

Getting a cab and travelling on buses -

Reading the grafitti about slashed seat affairs -



that's entertainment.

Why Do Fools Fall in Love -- Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers
****************************************



Why do birds sing so gay 

And lovers await the break of day

Why do they fall in love

Why does the rain fall from up above

Why do fools fall in love

Why do they fall in love

Love is a losing game

Love can be a shame I 

know of a fool, you see

For that fool is me

Tell me why, tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay 

And lovers await the break of day

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat

For I know it will reach defeat

Tell me why, tell me why

Why do fools fall in love

Tell me why, tell me why

What's Love Got To Do With It -- Tina Turner
****************************************



You must understand
though the touch of your hand
makes my pulse react
that it's only the thrill
a boy meeting girl
opposites attract

It's physical
only logical
You must try to ignore
that it means more than that

Oh what's love got to do
got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
that I'm acting confused
when you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I read it someplace
I've got cause to be

Well there's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
you do it for me

Oh what's love got to do
got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

I've been taking on a new direction
and I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh what's love got to do
got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

Iron Man -- Black Sabbath
****************************************



Has he lost his mind?

Can he see or is he blind?

Can he walk at all

Or if he moves will he fall?



Is he alive or dead?

Has he thoughts within his head?

We'll just pass him there

Why should we even care?



He was turned to steel

In the great magnetic field

When he travelled time

For the future of mankind



Nobody wants him

He just stares at the world

Planning his vengeance

That he will soon unfold



Now the time is here

For Iron Man to spread fear

Vengeance from the grave

Kills the people he once saved



Nobody wants him

They just turn their heads

Nobody helps him

Now he has his revenge



Heavy bolts of lead

Fills his victims full of dread

Running as fast as they can

Iron Man lives again!

In Dreams -- Roy Orbison
****************************************



A candy-colored clown they call the sandman

Tiptoes to my room every night

Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

"Go to sleep. Everything is all right."



I close my eyes, Then I drift away 

Into the magic night. I softly say

A silent prayerLike dreamers do.

Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you.



In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you.

In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together 

In dreams, In dreams.



But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone.

I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry.

I remember that you said goodbye.



It's too bad that all these things, Can only happen in my dreams

Only in dreams In beautiful dreams.

I put a spell on you

Watch out, I ain't lying 



I love you, I love you

Because you're mine, mine, mine

Comfortably Numb -- Pink Floyd
****************************************



Hello, hello, hello 

Is there anybody in there? 

Just nod if you can hear me. 

Is there anyone at home? 



Come on, come on down, 

I hear you're feeling down. 

Well I can ease your pain, 

Get you on your feet again. 



Relax, relax, relax 

I need some information first. 

Just the basic facts. 

Can you show me where it hurts? 



There is no pain, you are receding. 

A distant ship's smoke on the horizon. 

You are only coming through in waves. 

Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying. 



When I was a child, I had a fever. 

My hands felt just like two balloons. 

Now I've got that feeling once again. 

I can't explain, you would not understand. 

This is not how I am. 



I have become comfortably numb. 



[guitar solo] 



I have become comfortably numb. 



OK, OK, OK 

Just a little pin prick. 

There'll be no more, aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh, 

But you may feel a little sick. 



Can you stand up, stand up, stand up. 

I do believe it's working good. 

That'll keep you going for the show. 

Come on, it's time to go. 



There is no pain, you are receding. 

A distant ship's smoke on the horizon. 

You are only coming through in waves. 

Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying. 



When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse 

Out of the corner of my eye. 

I turned to look, but it was gone. 

I cannot put my finger on it now. 

The child has grown, the dream is gone. 



I have become comfortably numb.

Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood -- Animals

Baby, do you understand me now

Sometimes I feel a little mad

But don't you know that no one alive

Can always be an angel

When things go wrong I seem to be bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood



Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree

With a joy that's hard to hide

And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry

Then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood



If I seem edgy I want you to know

That I never mean to take it out on you

Life has it's problems and I get my share

And that's one thing I never meant to do

Because I love you



Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human

Have thoughts like any other one

Sometimes I find myself long regretting 

Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood



Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood



Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Wish You Were Here -- Pink Floyd
****************************************



So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell,
blue skies from pain
can you tell a green field,
from a cold steel rail,
a smile from a veil
do you think you can tell,
did they get your to trade,
your heroes for ghosts,
hot ashes for trees,
hot air for a cool breeze,
cold comfort for change
did you exchange,
a walk on part in the war
for a lead role in a cage.

How i wish, how i wish you were here
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
running over the same old ground, have we found, the same old fears,
Wish You Were Here

Many Rivers to Cross -- Jimmy Cliff
****************************************



Many rivers to cross

But I can't seem to find my way over

Wandering I am lost

As I travel along the white cliffs of dover



Many rivers to cross

And it's only my will that keeps me alive

I've been licked, washed up for years

And I merely survive because of my pride



And this loneliness won't leave me alone

It's such a drag to be on your own

My woman left me and she didn't say why

Well, I guess I'll have to cry



Many rivers to cross

But just where to begin I'm playing for time

There have been times I find myself

Thinking of committing some dreadful crime



Yes, I've got many rivers to cross

But I can't seem to find my way over

Wandering, I am lost

As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover



Yes, I've got many rivers to cross

And I merely survive because of my will...

Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl. 
And with the way you look I understand 
That you are not impressed. 
But I heard you let that little friend of mine 
Take off your party dress. 
I'm not going to get too sentimental 
Like those other sticky valentines, 
'cause I don't know if you've been loving somebody. 
I only know it isn't mine. 
 
Alison, I know this world is killing you. 
Oh, alison, my aim is true. 
 
Well I see you've got a husband now. 
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying 
In the wedding cake?  
You used to hold him right in your hand. 
I'll bet he took all he could take. 
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking 
When I hear the silly things that you say. 
I think somebody better put out the big light, 
Cause I can't stand to see you this way. 
 
Alison, I know this world is killing you. 
Oh, alison, my aim is true. 
My aim is true.

Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no intelligence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not go back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely

Hey fellas, have you heard the news? You know that Annie's back in town? 

It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down. 

Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago, 

But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows. 



Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you. 

The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue. 

Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love; 

But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above. 



People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat, 

I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at. 

One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do, 

It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you. 

I try to make love but it ain't no use. 



Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved; 

Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried. 

Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way; 

Go away, Heartbreaker

Cortez The Killer -- Neil Young
****************************************



He came dancing across the water

       With his galleons and guns

       Looking for the new world

       In that palace in the sun.



       On the shore lay Montezuma

       With his coca leaves and pearls

       In his halls he often wondered

       With the secrets of the worlds.



       And his subjects gathered 'round him

       Like the leaves around a tree

       In their clothes of many colors

       For the angry gods to see.



       And the women all were beautiful

       And the men stood straight and strong

       They offered life in sacrifice

       So that others could go on.



       Hate was just a legend

       And war was never known

       The people worked together

       And they lifted many stones.



       They carried them to the flatlands

       And they died along the way

       But they built up with their bare hands

       What we still can't do today.



       And I know she's living there

       And she loves me to this day

       I still can't remember when

       Or how I lost my way.



       He came dancing across the water

       Cortez, Cortez

       What a killer.

-K. SHOCKLEE-E. SADLER-C. RIDENHOUR
1989 the number another summer (get down)
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin' your heart cause I know you got sould
(Brothers and sisters, hey)
Listen if you're missin' y'all
Swingin' while I'm singin'
Givin' whatcha gettin'
Knowin' what I know
While the Black bands sweatin'
And the rhythm rhymes rollin'
Got to give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We got to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power
Chorus
As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the prides arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
from the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothin's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same
Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved lets get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
(Yo) bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say...
Fight the Power
Chorus
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was
Simple and plain
Mother fuck him and John Wayne
Cause I'm Black and I'm proud
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check
Don't worry be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here
(Get it) lets get this party started right
Right on, c'mon
What we got to say
Power to the people no delay
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be
(Fight the Power)

Dancing Barefoot -- Patti Smith
****************************************



She is benediction 
She is addicted to thee 
She is the root connection 
She is connecting with he 
 
Here I go and I don't know why 
I fell so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me... 
 
I'm dancing barefoot 
Heading for a spin 
Some strange music draws me in 
Makes me come on like some heroin/e 
 
She is sublimation 
She is the essence of thee 
She is concentrating on 
He, who is chosen by she 
 
Here I go and I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly, 
Could it be he's taking over me... 
 
[chorus] 
 
She is re-creation 
She, intoxicated by thee 
She has the slow sensation that 
He is levitating with she ... 
 
Here I go and I don't know why, 
I spin so ceaselessly, 
'til I lose my sense of gravity... 
 
[chorus] 
 
(oh God I fell for you ...) 
 
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face 
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself 
Grave visitations 
What is it that calls to us?  
Why must we pray screaming?  
Why must not death be redefined?  
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms 
And whirl on a pane of glass 
An afixiation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree 
The hands of he and the promise that s/he is blessed among women. 
 
(oh God I fell for you ...)

Ooh baby love, my baby love

But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay
Need ya, need ya
Baby love, ooh, baby love

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away

Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me
My love, my baby love

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
'Til it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away

Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do

And darling, I'm
(I'm so surprised)
Oh, when I first realized
(I realized)
That a-you were fooling me

And darling

They say that our love won't grow
But I just wanna tell them
(Ooo-ooo-ooo)
That they don't know-oh-ho

For as long
As you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea

And of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
That you'll be my girl

And woo-ooo-ooo
(Wanting you)
Wanting you
(Oh-ooh, I'm lonely and blue)
I'm so-whoa, lonely
(That's what love will do)

The End -- The Doors
****************************************



This is the end, Beautiful friend

This is the end, My only friend, the end

Of our elaborate plans, the end

Of everything that stands, the end

No safety or surprise, the end

I'll never look into your eyes...again

Can you picture what will be, So limitless and free

Desperately in need...of some...stranger's hand

In a...desperate land

Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain

And all the children are insane, All the children are insane

Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

There's danger on the edge of town

Ride the King's highway, baby

Weird scenes inside the gold mine

Ride the highway west, baby

Ride the snake, ride the snake

To the lake, the ancient lake, baby

The snake is long, seven miles

Ride the snake...he's old, and his skin is cold

The west is the best, The west is the best

Get here, and we'll do the rest

The blue bus is callin' us, The blue bus is callin' us

Driver, where you taken' us

The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on

He took a face from the ancient gallery 

And he walked on down the hall

He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he

Paid a visit to his brother, and then he

He walked on down the hall, and

And he came to a door...and he looked inside

Father, yes son, I want to kill you

Mother...I want to...fuck you

C'mon baby, take a chance with us X3

And meet me at the back of the blue bus

Doin' a blue rock, On a blue bus

Doin' a blue rock, C'mon, yeah

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

This is the end, Beautiful friend

This is the end, My only friend, the end

It hurts to set you free

But you'll never follow me

The end of laughter and soft lies

The end of nights we tried to die

This is the end

That's The Way Of The World -- Earth Wind &amp; Fire
****************************************



Hearts of fire creates love desire

Take you high and higher to the world you belong

Hearts of fire creates love desire

High and higher to your place on the throne



We've come together on this special day

To sing our message loud and clear

Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days

Future pass, they disappear



You will find peace of mind

If you look way down in your heart and soul

Don't hesitate 'cause the world seems cold

Stay young at heart 'cause you're never (never, never, ..) old at heart



That's the way of the world

Plant your flower and you grow a pearl

A child is born with a heart of gold

The way of the world makes his heart grow cold

I Can't Make You Love Me -- Bonnie Raitt
****************************************



Turn down the lights, turn down the bed 

Turn down these voices inside my head 

Lay down with me, tell me no lies 

Just hold me close, don't patronize - don't patronize me 



Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 

You can't make your heart feel something it won't 

Here in the dark, in these final hours 

I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power 

But you won't, no you won't 

'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't 



I'll close my eyes, then I won't see 

The love you don't feel when you're holding me 

Morning will come and I'll do what's right 

Just give me till then to give up this fight 

And I will give up this fight 



Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 

You can't make your heart feel something it won't 

Here in the dark, in these lonely hours 

I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power 

But you won't, no you won't 

'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

Subterranean Homesick Blues -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

Wild Horses -- Rolling Stones
****************************************



Childhood living is easy to do 

The things you wanted I bought them for you 

Graceless lady you know who I am 

You know I can't let you slide through my hands 



Wild horses couldn't drag me away 

Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 



I watched you suffer a dull aching pain 

Now you decided to show me the same 

No sweeping exits or offstage lines 

Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 



Wild horses couldn't drag me away 

Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 



I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie 

I have my freedom but I don't have much time 

Faith has been broken, tears must be cried 

Let's do some living after we die 



Wild horses couldn't drag me away 

Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day 



Wild horses couldn't drag me away 

Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

"Sweet Jane"
Lou Reed
Velvet Underground
Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his corset, and Jane is in her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band.  Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes.
Sweet Jane!  Whoa!  Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something,
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them save their monies, ha,
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh!  Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play,
The classical music there, Jim.
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers".
All you protest kids.
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah,
Sweet Jane!  Come on baby! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other peoples, they have to work.  Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers,
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt.
Y'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh,
That wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa,
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!
Sweet Jane!  Whoa-oh-oh!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane.  Sweet Jane.
Sweet Jane.  Sweet Jane.

so I took a big chance at the high school dance

with a missy who was ready to play

wasn't me she was foolin'

'cause she knew what she was doin'

and I knowed love was here to stay

when she told me to 



walk this way, walk this way

schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy

little skirt's climbin' way up the knee

there was three young ladies in the school gym locker

when I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady

till the boys told me somethin' I missed

then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor

so I gave her just a little kiss

like this!

Get out my life, why don't cha babe 
'cause you don't really love me 
You just keep me hangin' on 
You don't really need me 
But you keep me hangin' on 
 
Why do you keep a coming around 
Playing with my heart?  
Why don't you get out of my life 
And let me make a new start?  
Let me get over you 
The way you've gotten over me 
 
Set me free, why don't cha babe 
Let me be, why don't cha babe 
'cause you don't really love me 
You just keep me hangin' on 
Now you don't really want me 
You just keep me hangin' on 
 
You say although we broke up 
You still wanna be just friends 
But how can we still be friends 
When seeing you only breaks my heart again 
And there ain't nothing I can do about it 
 
Woo, set me free, why don't cha babe 
Woo, get out my life, why don't cha babe 
Set me free, why don't cha babe 
Get out my life, why don't cha babe 
 
You claim you still care for me 
But your heart and soul needs to be free 
Now that you've got your freedom 
You wanna still hold on to me 
You don't want me for yourself 
So let me find somebody else hey! 
 
Why don't you be a man about it 
And set me free 
Now you don't care a thing about me 
You're just using me 
Go on, get out, get out of my life 
And let me sleep at night 
'cause you don't really love me 
You just keep me hangin' on...

 Out here in the fields
 I fight for my meals
 I get my back into my living
 I don't need to fight
 To prove I'm right
 I don't need to be forgiven

 Don't cry
 Don't raise your eye
 It's only teenage wasteland

 Sally ,take my hand
 Travel south crossland
 Put out the fire
 Don't look past my shoulder
 The exodus is here
 The happy ones are near
 Let's get together
 Before we get much older

 Teenage wasteland
 It's only teenage wasteland
 Teenage wasteland
 Oh, oh
 Teenage wasteland
 They're all wasted!

The Harder They Come -- Jimmy Cliff
****************************************



Verse 1 Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky 

Waiting for me when I die 

But between the day you're born and when you die 

They never seem to hear even your cry 



Refrain So as sure as the sun will shine 

I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine 

And then the harder they come 

The harder they fall, one and all 

Ooh, the harder they come 

Harder they fall, one and all 



Verse 2 Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down 

Trying to drive me underground 

And they think that they have got the battle won 

I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done 



Refrain 'Cause as sure as the sun will shine 

I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine 

And then the harder they come 

The harder they fall, one and all 

Ooh, the harder they come 

Harder they fall, one and all 



Verse 3 And I keep on fighting for the things I want 

Though I know that when you're dead you can't 

But I'd rather be a free man in my grave 

Than living as a puppet or a slave 



Refrain So as sure as the sun will shine 

I'm gonna get my share right now, what's mine 

And then the harder they come 

The harder they fall, one and all 

Ooh, the harder they come 

Harder they fall, one and all

Ah, I should have known it from the very start,
This girl will leave me with a broken heart.
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue.

The touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace.
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue.

Ah, she likes to travel around,
She'll love you but she'll put you down.
Now people let me put you wise,

I fell in love and my love still grows.
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue.

  In the citaaay of L.A.

  In the citaaay of good ol' Watts

  In the citaaay, the city of Compton

  We keep it rockin!  We keep it rockin!



Verse One: Dr. Dre



Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west  

A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness

The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest  

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex

We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat 

the state where ya never find a dance floor empty

And pimps be on a mission for them greens 

lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends

I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes 

ever since honeys was wearin sassoon

Now it's '95  and they clock me and watch me 

Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace

It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay  

Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay

Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way  

Dre puttin it down for 

Californ-i-a

(repeat 1)



2-Shake it shake it baby

  Shake it shake it baby

  Shake it shake it mama

  Shake it Cali

  Shake it shake it baby

  Shake it shake it shake it shake it...



Verse Two: 2Pac



Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin

Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin

Fiendin for money and alcohol

the life of a west side playa where cowards die

Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die

In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)

Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do

Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews

Famous cause we program worldwide 

Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rose Grands

Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side 

So you know the row won't bow down to no man

Say what you say 

But give me that bomb beat from Dre

Candle In The Wind -- Elton John
****************************************



Goodbye Norma Jean

Though I never knew you at all

You had the grace to hold yourself

While those around you crawled

They crawled out of the woodwork

And they whispered into your brain

They set you on the treadmill

And they made you change your name



And it seems to me you lived your life

Like a candle in the wind

Never knowing who to cling to

When the rain set in

And I would have liked to have known you

But I was just a kid

Your candle burned out long before

Your legend ever did



Loneliness was tough

The toughest role you ever played

Hollywood created a superstar

And pain was the price you paid

Even when you died

Oh the press still hounded you

All the papers had to say

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude



Goodbye Norma Jean

From the young man in the 22nd row

Who sees you as something as more than sexual

More than just our Marilyn Monroe

That Lady (Part 1 and 2) -- Isley Brothers

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)

Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)

Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)

Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)



Hear me calling out to you,

Cause that's all that I can do.

Your eyes tell me to pursue.

But you say, "Look, yeah, but don't touch."



Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)

Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)

Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)

Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)



I would dance upon a string.

Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.

I would give her anything,

If she would just do what I say.



Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)

Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)

Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)

Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)



I would love to take her home,

But her heart is made of stone.

Gotta keep on keeping on.

If I don't, she'll do me wrong.

Spanish Harlem -- Ben E. King
****************************************



(Words and Music by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector)



There is a rose in Spanish Harlem 

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem 

It is a special one, it's never seen the sun 

It only comes out when the moon is on the run 

And all the stars are gleaming 

It's growing in the street right up through the concrete 

But soft and sweet and dreamin' 



There is a rose in Spanish Harlem 

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem 

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul 

And starts a fire there and then I lose control 

I have to beg your pardon 

I'm going to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden 

I'm going to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden 



(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem) 

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la 

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem) 

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la 

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)

****************************************



Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Pretending I'm doing well
My need is such
I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown

Too real when i feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're...
Pretending that you're still around

Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

My tongue get tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

Would you know my name 

If I saw you in heaven 

Will it be the same 

If I saw you in heaven 

I must be strong, and carry on 

Cause I know I don't belong 

Here in heaven 



Would you hold my hand 

If I saw you in heaven 

Would you help me stand 

If I saw you in heaven 

I'll find my way, through night and day 

Cause I know I just can't stay 

Here in heaven 



Time can bring you down 

Time can bend your knee 

Time can break your heart 

Have you begging please 

Begging please 



(instrumental) 



Beyond the door 

There's peace I'm sure. 

And I know there'll be no more... 

Tears in heaven 



Would you know my name 

If I saw you in heaven

If I saw you in heaven

Watching The Detectives -- Elvis Costello
****************************************



Nice girls, not one with a defect,

Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct.

Red dogs under illegal legs.

She looks so good that he gets down and begs.



Chorus:

She is watching the detectives.

\"Ooh, he's so cute!\"

She is watching the detectives

When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

They beat him up until the teardrops start,

But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.



Long shot at that jumping sign,

Invisible shivers running down my spine.

Cut to baby taking off her clothes.

Close-up of the sign that says, \"We never close\"

He snatch at you and you match his cigarette,    ?????

She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet.

I don't know how much more of this I can take.

She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake.



-chorus-



You think you're alone until you realize you're in it.

Now fear is here to stay.  Love is here for a visit.

They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.

Someone's scratching at the window.  I wonder who is it?

The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents

Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.

Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay,

It only took my little fingers to blow you away.



Just like watching the detectives.

Don't get cute!

It's just like watching the detectives.

I get so angry when the teardrops start,

But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no hearts.



Watching the detectives.

It's just like watching the detectives.

Watching the detectives. (repeat and fade)

I see trouble on the way. 

I see earthquakes and lightnin'. 

I see bad times today. 



Don't go around tonight, 

Well, it's bound to take your life, 

There's a bad moon on the rise. 



I hear hurricanes ablowing. 

I know the end is coming soon. 

I fear rivers over flowing. 

I hear the voice of rage and ruin. 



Don't go around tonight, 

Well, it's bound to take your life, 

There's a bad moon on the rise. 

All right! 



Hope you got your things together. 

Hope you are quite prepared to die. 

Looks like we're in for nasty weather. 

One eye is taken for an eye. 



Don't go around tonight, 

Well, it's bound to take your life, 

There's a bad moon on the rise. 



Don't go around tonight,

With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free 

It's alright she says it's alright 

Take anything you want from me,

anything.

Nowhere To Run -- Reeves Martha And The Vandellas
****************************************



Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
It's not love I'm running from
It's the heartbreak I know will come
Cause I know you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me
Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take you take with me
Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be
Each night as I sleep
Into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you
When I look in the mirror to comb my hair
I see your face just a-smilin' there
Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me
How can I fight a love that shouldn't be
When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me
My love reaches so high I can't get over it
It's so wide I can't get around it
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Just can't get away from you baby, no matter how I try

Killing Me Softly With His Song -- Roberta Flack
****************************************



Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song ... 

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song ... 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on ...

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song ... 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
and he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song ... 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life.
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song ... 
With his song ...

They said release "Remote Control"
But we didn't want it on the label
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"
The people laughed but the press went mad
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
At every hotel we was met by the Law
Come for the party - come to make sure!
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song
They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee
An' worry about it later
Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand
Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand!
All over the news spread fast
They're dirty, they're filthy
They ain't gonna last!
This is Joe Public speaking
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind
Total
C-o-n control - that means you!

The next time you see me comin' you better run"

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose

Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes

He asked poor Howard where can I go

Howard said there's only one place I know

Sam said tell me quick man I got to run

0l' Howard just pointed with his gun

And said that way down on Highway 61



Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King

I got forty red white and blue shoe strings

And a thousand telephones that don't ring

Do you know where I can get rid of these things

And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son

And he said yes I think it can be easily done

Just take everything down to Highway 61 Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night

Told the first father that things weren't right

My complexion she said is much too white

He said come here and step into the light

He says hmm you're right

Let me tell the second mother this has been done

But the second mother was with the seventh son

And they were both out on Highway 61



Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored

He was tryin' to create a next world war

He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor

He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before

But yes I think it can be very easily done

We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun

And have it on Highway 61

When you come to me on a summer breeze 
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave. 
And it's me you need to show

'Cause we're living in a world of fools 
Breaking us down when they all should let us be.

you know the door to my barest soul. 
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour.

And you may not think that I care for you 
When you know down inside that I really do 
And it's me you need to show

Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.

Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes.

Dawn-light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.

Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.

I walked into such a sad time at the station.

As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;

Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.

Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.

Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.

She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;

Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.

The Wind Cries Mary -- Jimi Hendrix
****************************************



After all the jacks are in their boxes 

And the clowns have all gone to bed 

You can hear happiness staggering on down the street 

Footsteps dressed in red 

And the wind whispers Mary 



A broom is drearily sweeping 

Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life 

Somewhere a queen is weeping 

Somewhere a king has no wife 

And the wind it cries Mary 



The traffic-lights, they turn blue tomorrow 

And shine their emptiness down on my bed 

The tiny island sags downstream 

'Cause the life that lived is, is dead 

And the wind screams Mary 



Will the wind ever remember 

The names it has blown in the past? 

And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom 

It whispers no, this will be the last 

And the wind cries mary

Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)

I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Forgive me one more time, now (Can't explain)

I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me our ot my mind
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
I said I can't explain

Marquee Moon -- Television

(Verlaine)



I remember

how the darkness doubled

I recall

lightning struck itself.

I was listening

listening to the rain

I was hearing

hearing something else.



Life in the hive puckered up my night,

the kiss of death, the embrace of life.

There I stand neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting,

Hesitating...

I ain't waiting



I spoke to a man

down at the tracks.

I asked him

how he don't go mad.

He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy.

And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad."



Well a Cadillac

it pulled out of the graveyard.

Pulled up to me

all they said get in.

Then the Cadillac

it puttered back into the graveyard.

And me,

I got out again.

What I do know is that I love you
And I know that if you love me too

I can win your love for me

Fake Plastic Trees -- Radiohead

Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears me out, it wears her out
It wears me out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears me out, it wears her out
It wears me out, it wears her out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time

Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay.
Reason: it could polish up the grey.
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't country at all

Raving station, beside yourself

Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd.
Push that, push that, push that to the hull
That this isn't nothing at all.

Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio Free Europe, radio...

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fortunate at all

Raving station, beside yourself
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit

Decide yourself, calling all of the medias too fast

Keep me out of country in the word
Disappoint is into us absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road -- Elton John
****************************************



When are you gonna come down

When are you going to land

I should have stayed on the farm

I should have listened to my old man



You know you can't hold me forever

I didn't sign up with you

I'm not a present for your friends to open

This boy's too young to be singing the blues



So goodbye yellow brick road

Where the dogs of society howl

You can't plant me in your penthouse

I'm going back to my plough



Back to the howling old owl in the woods

Hunting the horny back toad

Oh I've finally decided my future lies

Beyond the yellow brick road



What do you think you'll do then

I bet that'll shoot down your plane

It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics

To set you on your feet again



Maybe you'll get a replacement

There's plenty like me to be found

Mongrels who ain't got a penny

Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

But I-I-I-I-I know deep down inside of me

I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride



Life is too short to have sorrow

You may be here today and gone tomorrow

You might as well get what you want

So go on and live, baby, go on and live

I Know You Got Soul -- Eric B. &amp; Rakim
****************************************



It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon 
As you hear it, pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow, 
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard,	it control 
Your body to dance (you got it) soul, 
Ditects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme... 
I got soul 
 
You got it (4x) 
I know you got soul 
 
Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on soul train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric b. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next?  then you gotta have soul 
'cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The r, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you wanna get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to mc is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 
 
You got it (5x) 
 
I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the r's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'cause almost anyone can relate to... 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt?  
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 
 
You got it (4x) 
 
Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from uptown, brooklyn- bound, 
The bronx, queens, or long island sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, rakim 'll say peace 
 
You got it (10x)

Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man

Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand

And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand



Jesus freaks out in the street

Handing tickets out for God

Turning back she just laughs

The boulevard is not that bad



Piano man he makes his stand

In the auditorium

Looking on she sings the songs

The words she knows, the tune she hums



But oh how it feels so real

Lying here with no one near

Only you and you can hear me

When I say softly, slowly



Hold me closer tiny dancer

Count the headlights on the highway

Lay me down in sheets of linen

you had a busy day today



Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band

Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man

A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three.

But it was just my 'magination, once again.

Running away with me.

Tell you it was just my 'magination,

Running away with me.



Paul: Every night on my knees I pray.



Dear Lord, hear my plea.

Don't ever let another take her love from me.

Or I will surely die. Hmm



(Her love is) heavenly.

When her arms enfold me.

I hear a tender rhapsody.

But in reality, she doesn't even know me.



Just my 'magination, once again.

Running away with me.

Oh, tell you it was just my 'magination,

Running away with me.



I never met her but I can't forget her.

Just my 'magination,

Running away with me.



Ooo, just my 'magination running away with me.

She's in my mind and hard to find.

Been down, isn't it a pity

Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city

  Go out and find a girl

  Come-on come-on and dance all night

  Despite the heat it'll be alright



  And babe, don't you know it's a pity

  That the days can't be like the nights

  In the summer, in the city

  In the summer, in the city



Cool town, evening in the city

Dressing so fine and looking so pretty

Cool cat, looking for a kitty

Gonna look in every corner of the city

Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop

Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop



  But at night it's a different world

  Go out and find a girl

  Come-on come-on and dance all night

  Despite the heat it'll be alright



  And babe, don't you know it's a pity

  That the days can't be like the nights

  In the summer, in the city

  In the summer, in the city



------ instrumental break ------



Hot town, summer in the city

Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty

Been down, isn't it a pity

Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city



All around, people looking half dead

Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head



  But at night it's a different world

  Go out and find a girl

  Come-on come-on and dance all night

  Despite the heat it'll be alright



  And babe, don't you know it's a pity

  That the days can't be like the nights

  In the summer, in the city

  In the summer, in the city

Can't Help Falling In Love -- Elvis Presley
****************************************



Wise men say only fools rush in

but I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay

would it be a sin

If I can't help falling in love with you



Like a river flows surely to the sea

Darling so it goes

some things are meant to be

take my hand, take my whole life too

for I can't help falling in love with you



Like a river flows surely to the sea

Darling so it goes

some things are meant to be

take my hand, take my whole life too

Remember (Walkin' in The Sand) -- The Shangri-Las
****************************************



(Written by George "Shadow" Morton)



Seems like the other day 

My baby went away 

He went away 'cross the sea 

It's been two years or so

Since I saw my baby go 

And then this letter came for me 

It said that we were through 

He found somebody new 

Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do? 

Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no 





(Remember) walkin' in the sand 

(Remember) walkin' hand in hand 

(Remember) the night was so exciting 

(Remember) smile was so inviting 

(Remember) then he touched my cheek 

(Remember) with his fingertips 

Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips 



Whatever happened to 

The boy that I once knew? 

The boy who said he'd be true 

Oh, what will happen to 

The life I gave to you? 

What will I do with it now? 



 

(Remember) walkin' in the sand 

(Remember) walkin' hand in hand 

(Remember) the night was so exciting 

(Remember) smile was so inviting 

(Remember) then he touched my cheek 

(Remember) with his fingertips 

Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips

(Big Star)
Won't you let me walk you home from school
Won't you let me meet you at the pool
Maybe Friday I can
Get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you - ooh
Won't you tell your dad "Get off my back"
Tell him what we said 'bout 'Paint It Black'
Rock 'n' roll is here to stay
Come inside now it's okay
And I'll shake you - ooh
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of
And would you be an outlaw for my love
If it's so then let me know
If it's "no", well, I can go
I won't make you - ooh

Don't Fear The Reaper -- Blue Oyster Cult
****************************************



All our times have come

Here but now they're gone

Seasons don't fear the reaper

Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain..we can be like they are

Come on baby...don't fear the reaper

Baby take my hand...don't fear the reaper

We'll be able to fly...don't fear the reaper

Baby I'm your man...



Valentine is done

Here but now they're gone

Romeo and Juliet

Are together in eternity...Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women everyday...Like Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women everyday...Redefine happiness

Another 40,000 coming everyday...We can be like they are

Come on baby...don't fear the reaper

Baby take my hand...don't fear the reaper

We'll be able to fly...don't fear the reaper

Baby I'm your man...



Love of two is one

Here but now they're gone

Came the last night of sadness

And it was clear she couldn't go on

Then the door was open and the wind appeared

The candles blew then disappeared

The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid

Come on baby...and she had no fear

And she ran to him...then they started to fly

They looked backward and said goodbye...she had become like they are

She had taken his hand...she had become like they are

Come on baby...don't fear the reaper

Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

CHORUS
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to Never-never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

CHORUS

Now I lay me down to sleep (x2)
I pray the Lord my soul to keep (x2)
If I die before I wake (x2)
I pray the Lord my soul to take (x2)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
Never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit: light
Enter: night

And if you keep on runnin'

You'll have to pay the price

Visions of Johanna -- Bob Dylan
****************************************



Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?  
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it 
And louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it 
Lights flicker from the opposite loft 
In this room the heat pipes just cough 
The country music station plays soft 
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off 
Just louise and her lover so entwined 
And these visions of johanna that conquer my mind 
 
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain 
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; train 
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight 
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane 
Louise, she's all right, she's just near 
She's delicate and seems like the mirror 
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear 
That johanna's not here 
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face 
Where these visions of johanna have now taken my place 
 
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously 
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously 
And when bringing her name up 
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me 
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all 
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall 
How can I explain?  
Oh, it's so hard to get on 
And these visions of johanna, they kept me up past the dawn 
 
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial 
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while 
But mona lisa musta had the highway blues 
You can tell by the way she smiles 
See the primitive wallflower freeze 
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze 
Hear the one with the mustache say, &amp;quot;jeeze 
I can't find my knees&amp;quot; 
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule 
But these visions of johanna, they make it all seem so cruel 
 
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him 
Sayin', &amp;quot;name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him&amp;quot; 
But like louise always says 
&amp;quot;ya can't look at much, can ya man? &amp;quot; 
As she, herself, prepares for him 
And madonna, she still has not showed 
We see this empty cage now corrode 
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed 
The fiddler, he now steps to the road 
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed 
On the back of the fish truck that loads 
While my conscience explodes 
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain 
And these visions of johanna are now all that remain

We've only just begun to live

White lace and promises

So many roads to choose

We start our walking

And learn to run

And yes! We've only just begun



(*) Sharin' horizons that are new to us

Watchin' the signs along the way

Talkin' it over just the two of us

Workin' together day to day, together

So much of life ahead

We'll find a place where there's room to grow

And yes! We've only just begun

I Believe I Can Fly -- R. Kelly

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

2-If I can see it, then I can do it
  If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

1-I believe I can fly
  I believe I can touch the sky
  I think about it every night and day
  Spread my wings and fly away
  I believe I can soar
  I see me running through that open door
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can fly
  (Oh) I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes the silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
(repeat 2, 1)

Could I believe in it?

Crossroads -- Cream
****************************************



I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.

Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.

Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Save me if you please."

I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.

Down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.

Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.

Well I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.

Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.

You can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside.

Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.

Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.

You can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside.

You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.*

Run, you can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.*

And I'm staying at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.

 * My original transcription used "friend boy", after viewing some sheet music I changed it to "friend poor". This is a common transcription of Eric's rendition, however after listening closely on the remastered "Those Were the Days" it is definitely "friend-boy" as in Johnson's take 2 version (which I'm listening to as I write this as I have at last purchased "The Complete Recordings" box set). The confusion is caused by Eric mimicing Johnson's accent on the "boy". Friend-boy is a dialectic substitute for boyfriend and Willie Brown was a very generous teacher of the blues to Robert.

It is also interesting how Eric has substantially reworked the lyrics, a traditional blues activity shown by the variation in Johnson's own consecutive takes. The "Going down to Rosedale" verse is actually lifted from Johnson's musically related "Traveling Riverside Blues" and Eric's riff also seems to be partly derived from that song.

 



Robert Johnson's Take 2 lyrics transcription:



Cross Road Blues 

by Robert Johnson (rec 27/11/1936, San Antonio, Texas)



I went down to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

I went down to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please."



Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride

Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride

Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by



Mmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here

oooo, ooee, eee boy, dark gon' catch me here

I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care



You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.

You can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.

Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe, I believe I'm sinking down.

And my brother was bailing hay

And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat

And Mama hollered at the back door

"Y'all remember to wipe your feet"

Then she said

"I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge

Today Billy Joe McAllister

Jumped off the Talahachee Bridge"

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

If she winks an eye, the bread slice turn to toast,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

If she got a lot, of what they call the most,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

The girl can't help it, she was born to please,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

And if she's got, a figure made to squeeze,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

Won't you kindly be aware, the girl can't help it,

The girl can't help it,

If she mesmerizes, every mother's son,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

If she's smiling, beefsteak become well done,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

She makes grand pa feel like twenty one,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

The girl can't help it, she was born to please,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

And if I go to her, on bended knees,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it,

Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it,

I can't help it,

Because I'm hoping, obviously,

That some day, the answer would be,

The girl can't help it, she's in love with me,

She can't help it, the girl can't help it.

Here come Pepe and she's got a friend in a Chevrolet

But she ain't running, she just walking a little slow,

and she ain't crying, shes just singin a little low....



"They say this city will make you dirty, but you look alright,

you feel real pretty when he's holding you tight"

City will make you mean

But that's the make up on your face

Love will wash you clean in the nights disgrace.

Find a block where your people can find you

Keep a third eye watching behind you

You never know when your making a memory

They will wish they were here together again, someday



Kids looking for something to get into--take a look:

Two for the movie show

Three in the back row

Hold on tight!



Remember you might have looked like cool twelve

But your fuse felt just like dynamite

City will make you dirty, but you look alright,

you feel real pretty when he's holding you tight

City will make you mean

But that's the make up on your face

Love will wash you clean in the night ...dirty dirty dirt dirt....



Take a walk around midnight in the City

Young Blood will find you there somewhere

Wanna tell you I don't love you

Tell you that we're through

I get up all choked up inside



When I call your name, girl

It starts the flame burning in my heart

Tearin' it all apart

No matter how I try

My love I cannot hide

Nobody on the road

nobody on the beach.

I feel it in the air: The summer's out of reach.

Empty lake

empty streets

the sun goes down alone.

I'm driving by your house though I know you're not home.

But I can see you

your brown skin shining in the sun



You got your hair comb'd back and sunglasses on

baby.

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights

I wonder if it was a dream.

Remember how you made me crazy

remember how I made you scream

And I don't understand what happened to our love



But baby

I'm gonna get you back



I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you

your brown skin shining in the sun



I see you walking real slow and you're smiling at ev'ryone.

I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

After the boys of summer have gone.

Out on the road today I saw a deadhead sticker on a cadillac.

A little voice inside my head said:

Don't look back

you can never look back.

I thought I knew what love was

what did I know?

Those days are gone forever

I should just let them go but:

I can see you

your brown skin shining in the sun



You got that top pulled down and that radio on

baby.

I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

After the boys of summer have gone.

I can see you

your brown skin shining in the sun



You got your hair slick'd back and your wavarers on

baby.

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

After the boys of summer have gone.

Fuck tha Police -- N.W.A.
****************************************



Right about now NWA court is in full effect. 

Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department. 

Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren Ice Cube and Eazy muthafuckin E. 

Order order order. Ice Cube take the muthafuckin stand. 

Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth 

and nothin but the truth so help your black ass? 



Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? 



Fuck tha police 

Comin straight from the underground 

Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown 

And not the other color so police think 

They have the authority to kill a minority 



Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one 

For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun 

To be beatin on, and throwin in jail 

We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell 



Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager 

With a little bit of gold and a pager 

Searchin my car, lookin for the product 

Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics 



You'd rather see me in the pen 

Then me and Lorenzo rollin in the Benzo 

Beat tha police outta shape 

And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape 

To tape off the scene of the slaughter 

Still can't swallow bread and water 



I don't know if they fags or what 

Search a nigga down and grabbin his nuts 

And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none 

But don't let it be a black and a white one 

Cuz they slam ya down to the street top 

Black police showin out for the white cop 



Ice Cube will swarm 

On any muthafucka in a blue uniform 

Just cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me 

A young nigga on a warpath 

And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath 

Of cops, dyin in LA 

Yo Dre, I got somethin to say 



Fuck the police (4X) 













M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident.> 



Fuck tha police and Ren said it with authority 

because the niggaz on the street is a majority. 

A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping 

and the motherfuckin' weapon 

is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law 

wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw 



Lights start flashin behind me 

But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me 

But that shit don't work, I just laugh 

Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path 



To the police I'm sayin fuck you punk 

Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk 

Pullin out a silly club, so you stand 

With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand 



But take off the gun so you can see what's up 

And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up 



Make ya think I'm a kick your ass 

But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast 

I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime 

But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time 



Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me 

Or any assho that threatens me 

I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope 

Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me 



The muthafuckin villian that's mad 

With potential to get bad as fuck 

So I'm a turn it around 

Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound 

Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat 



Takin out a police would make my day 

But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say 



Fuck the police (4X) 



Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. 

Get down and put your hands up where I can see em. 

Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor. 

[huh?]> 



and tell the jury how you feel abou this bullshit.> 



I'm tired of the muthafuckin jackin 

Sweatin my gang while I'm chillin in the shackin 

Shining tha light in my face, and for what 

Maybe it's because I kick so much butt 



I kick ass, or maybe cuz I blast 

On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigga 

Of any Uzi or an AK 

Cuz the police always got somethin stupid to say 



They put up my picture with silence 

Cuz my identity by itself causes violence 

The E with the criminal behavior 

Yeah, I'm a gansta, but still I got flavor 



Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got? 

A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot, 

By me, or another nigga. 

and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger 

[MC Ren: Sidle him, kid, he's from the old school, fool] 



And as you all know, E's here to rule 

Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror 

And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a 

Dumb muthafucka with a gun 



And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be tha one 

That I take out, and then get away 

And while I'm drivin off laughin 

This is what I'll say 



Fuck the police (4X) 



The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck, 

whitebread, chickenshit muthafucka. 

Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie. 

I want justice! I want justice! 

Fuck you, you black muthafucka!> 



Fuck the police (3X)

Suite: Judy Blue Eyes -- Crosby Stills Nash Young
****************************************



by Stephen Stills

 It's getting to the point
 Where I'm no fun anymore
 I am sorry
 Sometimes it hurts so badly
 I must cry out loud
 I am lonely
 I am yours, you are mine
 You are what you are
 And you make it hard-

 Remember what we've said and done and felt
 about each other
 Oh babe, have mercy
 Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
 I am not dreaming.
 I am yours, you are mine
 You are what you are
 And you make it hard-

 Tearing yourself away from me now
 You are free and I am crying
 This does not mean I don't love you
 I do, that's forever, yes and for always
 I am yours, you are mine
 You are what you are
 And you make it hard-

 Something inside is telling me that
 I've got your secret. Are you still listening?
 Fear is the lock, and laughter the key to your heart
 And I love you.

 I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are
 And you make it hard-
 And you make it hard-

 Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
 What have you got to lose?
 Tuesday mornin', please be gone I'm tired of you.
 What have you got to lose?
 Can I tell it like it is? Help me I'm sufferin'
 Listen to me baby-Help me I'm dyin'
 It's my heart that's a sufferin', it's a dyin'
 That's what I have to lose
 I've got an answer
 I'm going to fly away
 What have I got to lose?
 Will you come see me
 Thursdays and Saturdays?
 What have you got to lose?

 Chestnut brown canary
 Ruby throated sparrow
 Sing a song don't be long
 Thrill me to the marrow
 Voices of the angels ring around the moonlight
 Asking me, said she so free
 How can you catch the sparrow?
 Lacy, lilting
 Change my life, make it right
 Be my lady.
 Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo etc...

Nuthin But A G Thang -- Dr. Dre
****************************************



Nuthin' But A "G" Thang [Tha' cut!!]
  - Dr. Dre
[Intro]
One, two, three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre are at the do'
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
[Before I have to pull the scrap out the cut]
Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
'Cause ain't nothin' but a G thang, baaaaabay!
Two loced out G's so we're craaaaazay!
Death Row is the label that paaaaays me!
Unfadable, so please don't try to fade this [Hell yeah]
But, uh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'm a land 'em, understand?
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a trick I have ta' find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin' her man,
Learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now when she's burnin' I'm a chill for a minute
'Cause ain't no lovin' good enough to get burned while I'm up in it [Yeah]
Now that's realer than real-deal Holyfield
And now all you hookas and ho's know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to give 'em all a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
[Chorus 1]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre., creep to the mic like a phantom
Well I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creep-in'
But I damn near got capped, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the micro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I funks up on funky sh-[yeah]
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a tope but don't choke
If ya' do, ya' have no clue
O' what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do
[Chorus 2]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this, and we ain't got no love for those
So jus' chill, 'til the next episode
[Tha' mix]
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellified gangsta' lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a' old batch o' collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, the fresh N double O P
D O double G Y  D O double G ya' see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Hippin' ho's and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in a mood for another one a' those G hits
So Dre. [What up Dogg?]
We gotta give 'em what dey want [What's that, G?]
We gotta break 'em off somethin' [Hell yeah]
And it's gotta be bumpin' [City of Compton!]
It's where it's explained, so I'm a ask your attention
Mobbin' with the dog pound [Bow wow wow]
Droppin' the funky tracks is makin' the suckas jus' mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and you're bound ta' get smacked
My little homey Snoop Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to put the rap down, put the mac down
And if your woman wanna trip, I have ta' put the smack down
Yeah, and ya' don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on 'til the break dawn
C O M P T O N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the strength together
Like my homey D.O.C., no one can do it better
[Chorus 3]
Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this, and we ain't got no love for those
So jus' chill, 'til the next episode

Piano Man -- Billy Joel
****************************************



It's nine o'clock on a Saturday 
the regular crowd shuffles in 
There's an old man sitting next to me 
Makin' love to his tonic and gin 
He say, Son can you play me a memory 
I'm not really sure how it goes 
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete 
When I wore a younger man's clothes 
Da da da de de da 
da da de de da da da 
Sing us a song, you're the piano man 
sing us a song tonight 
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody 
And you've got us feelin' alright 
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine 
He gets me my drinks for free 
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke 
But there's someplace that he'd rather be 
He says Bill, I believe this is killing me 
As the smile ran away from his face 
Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star 
If I could get out of this place 
Now Paul is a real estate novelist 
Who never had time for a wife 
And he's talking with Davy who's still in the navy 
And probably will be for life 
And the waitress is practicing politics 
As the businessmen slowly get stoned 
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness 
But it's better than drinking alone 
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday, 
And the manager gives me a smile 
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see 
To forget about life for awhile. 
And the piano sounds like a carnival 
And the microphone smells like a beer 
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar 
And say "Man, what are you doin' here?" 
Da da da de de da 
da da de de da da da 
Sing us a song, you're the piano man 
Sing us a song tonight. 
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody 
And you've got us feelin' alright.

Lola -- The Kinks
****************************************



I met her in a club down in North Soho

Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Cherry  Cola

C-O-L-A Cola.



She walked up to me and she asked me to dance.

I asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"

L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo Lola



Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy,

But when she squeesed me tight she nearly broke my spine

Oh my Lola, lo lo lo Lola



Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand

Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man

Oh my Lola, lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo Lola



Well, we drank champagne and danced all night,

Under electric candlelight,

She picked me up and sat me on her knee,

She said, "Little boy won't you come home with me?"



Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,

But when I looked in her eyes,

I almost fell for my Lola,

Lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo Lola



I pushed her away.  I walked to the door.

I fell to the floor.  I got down on my knees.

I looked at her, and she at me.



Well that's the way that I want it to stay.

I always want it to be that way for my Lola.

Lo lo lo Lola.



Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls.

It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world,

except for Lola.  Lo lo lo Lola.  Lo lo lo Lola.



Well I left home just a week before,

and I never ever kissed a woman before,

Lola smiled and took me by the hand,

she said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man."



Well I'm not the world's most masculine man,

but I know what I am and that I'm a man,

so is Lola.

Lo lo lo Lola.  Lo lo lo Lola.

And call me the tumblin' dice. 



Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry, 

Don't you see the time flashin' by. 

Honey, got no money,

Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider, 

You can be my partner in crime. 



But baby, I can't stay, 

You got to roll me and call me the tumblin', 

Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice. 



Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter, 

Playin' the field ev'ry night.

Got to roll me, Got to roll me, Got to roll me (Oh yeah)

Got to roll me. Got to roll me, Got to roll me ( Keep on rolling, Keep on rolling)

Smoke On The Water -- Deep Purple
****************************************



We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky, Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky, Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky, Smoke on the water

A world in white gets underway

And I want to be with you

Nothing changes on New Year's Day.
I will be with you again.
I will be with you again.

Under a blood-red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white

Arms entwined
the chose few

Newspaper say
it says it's true it's true.
And we can break through

I will begin again
I will begin again

Oh and maybe the time is right

Oh maybe tonight.
I will be with you again.
I will be with you again.

And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage

Though I want to be with you

To be with you nightand day.
Nothing changes on New Year's Day.

Wearin' her wig hat and shades to match

White Man In Hammersmith Palais -- Clash
****************************************



Midnight to six man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and Leroy Smart
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backing bands sound systems
And if they've got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack
'Cos it won't get you anywhere
Fooling with your guns
The British Army is waiting out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons
White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up Robin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution
Punk rockers in the UK
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fighting
For a good place under the lighting
The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits, ha you think it's funny
Turning rebellion into money
All over people changing their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway
I'm the all night drug-prowling wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
I'm the white man in the Palais
Just lookin' for fun
I'm only
Looking for fun

Midnight Train To Georgia -- Gladys Knight And The Pips
****************************************



L.A. proved too much for the man,

So he's leavin' the life he's come to know,

He said he's goin' back to find

Ooh, what's left of his world,

The world he left behind

Not so long ago.

He's leaving,

On that midnight train to Georgia,

And he's goin' back

To a simpler place and time.

And I'll be with him

On that midnight train to Georgia,

I'd rather live in his world

Than live without him in mine.

He kept dreamin'

That someday he'd be a star.

But he sure found out the hard way

That dreams don't always come true.

So he pawned all his hopes

and he even sold his old car

Bought a one way ticket

To the life he once knew,

Oh yes he did,

He said he would

Be leavin

On that midnight train to Georgia,

And he's goin' back

To a simpler place and time.

And I'll be with him

On that midnight train to Georgia,

I'd rather live in his world

Than live without him in mine.

Go, gonna board, gonna board,

Gonna board the midnight train.

Gotta go, gonna board

Gonna board

Gonna board the midnight train

Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way. 

Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay. 

But now it's time for me to go. The autumn moon lights my way. 

For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way. 

Sometimes I grow so tired, but I know I've got one thing I got to do... 



*Ramble On, And now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song. 

I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl, on my way. 

I've been this way ten years to the day, Ramble On, 

Gotta find the queen of all my dreams. 



Got no time to for spreadin' roots, The time has come to be gone. 

And to' our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to Ramble On. 



* Chorus 



Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear. 

How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air. 

T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair. 

But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her....yeah. 



* Chorus 



Gonna ramble on, sing my song. Gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby... 

Gonna work my way, round the world. I can't stop this feelin' in my heart 

Gotta keep searchin' for my baby. I can't find my bluebird!

Pink Houses -- John Mellencamp

There's a black man with a black cat livin' in a black neighborhood

He's got an interstate runnin' through his front yard

You know he thinks that he's got it so good

And there's a woman in the kitchen cleanin' up the evenin' slop

And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin', I can remember when 

   you could stop a clock."



CHORUS:

Oh but ain't that America for you and me

Ain't that America somethin' to see baby 

Ain't that America home of the free

Little pink houses for you and me



There's a young man in a t-shirt

Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station

He's got greasy hair, greasy smile

He says, "Lord this must be my destination."

'Cause they told me when I was younger

"Boy you're gonna be president."

But just like everything else those old crazy dreams

Just kinda came and went



CHORUS



Well there's people and more people

What do they know know know

Go to work in some high rise

And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico

Ooh yeah

And ther's winners and there's losers

But they ain't no big deal

'Cause the simple man baby pays for the thrills, the bills, 

     the pills that kill

I Shot The Sheriff -- Bob Marley

I shot the sheriff

But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!

I shot the sheriff

But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)

Yeah! All around in my home town,

They're tryin' to track me down;

They say they want to bring me in guilty

For the killing of a deputy,

For the life of a deputy.

But I say:



Oh, now, now. Oh!

(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.

(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)

Oh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!

I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -

(And they say it is a capital offence.)

Yeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!



Sheriff John Brown always hated me,

For what, I don't know:

Every time I plant a seed,

He said kill it before it grow -

He said kill them before they grow.

And so:



Read it in the news:

(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!

(But I swear it was in self-defence.)

Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)

I say: I shot the sheriff,

But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!



Freedom came my way one day

And I started out of town, yeah!

All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown

Aiming to shoot me down,

So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:

If I am guilty I will pay.



(I shot the sheriff,)

But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),

I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!

(I shot the sheriff.) I did!

But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)



Reflexes had got the better of me

And what is to be must be:

Every day the bucket a-go a well,

One day the bottom a-go drop out,

One day the bottom a-go drop out.

I say:



I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.

Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!

I - I (shot the sheriff) -

But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!

Mm-hmm 

Gee, it must be great riding with him 

Is he picking you up after school today?

By the way, where'd you meet him? 



I met him at the candy store 

He turned around and smiled at me 

You get the picture? (yes, we see) 

That's when I fell for (the leader of the pack) 



My folks were always putting him down (down, down) 

They said he came from the wrong side of town 

(whatcha mean when ya say that he came from the wrong side of town?) 

They told me he was bad 

But I knew he was sad 

That's why I fell for (the leader of the pack) 



One day my dad said, "Find someone new" 

I had to tell my Jimmy we're through 

(whatcha mean when ya say that ya better go find somebody new?) 

He stood there and asked me why 

But all I could do was cry 

I'm sorry I hurt you (the leader of the pack) 



[spoken] 

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye 

The tears were beginning to show 

As he drove away on that rainy night 

I begged him to go slow 

But whether he heard, I'll never know 



Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out! 



I felt so helpless, what could I do? 

Remembering all the things we'd been through 

In school they all stop and stare 

I can't hide the tears, but I don't care 

I'll never forget him (the leader of the pack) 



The leader of the pack - now he's gone 

The leader of the pack - now he's gone

 I don't know just where I'm going
 But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
 'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
 When I put a spike into my vein
 And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
 When I'm rushing on my run
 And I feel just like Jesus' son
 And I guess that I just don't know
 And I guess that I just don't know

 I have made the big decision
 I'm gonna try to nullify my life
 'Cause when the blood begins to flow
 When it shoots up the dropper's neck
 When I'm closing in on death
 And you can't help me now, you guys
 And a
You can all go take a walk
 And I guess that I just don't know
 And I guess that I just don't know

 I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
 I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
 On a great big clipper ship
 Going from this land here to that
 In a sailor's suit and cap
 Away from the big city
 Where a man can not be free
 Of all of the evils of this town
 And of himself, and those around
 Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
 Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

 Heroin, be the death of me
 Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
 Because a mainer to my vein
 Leads to a center in my head
 And then I'm better off and dead
 Because when the smack begins to flow
 I really don't care anymore
 About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
 And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
 And everybody puttin' everybody else down
 And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

 'Cause when the smack begins to flow
 Then I really don't care anymore
 Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
 And that blood is in my head
 Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
 Then thank your God that I'm not aware
 And thank God that I just don't care
 And I guess I just don't know

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 

of every head he's had the pleasure to know 

And all the people that come and go stop to say hello 

On the corner is a banker with a motor car 

the little children laugh at him behind his back 

And the banker never wears a "mac" in the pouring rain 

Very strange 



Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 

Wet beneath the blue suburban skies 

I sit and meanwhile back in 



Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass 

And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen 

He likes to keep his fire engine clean 

It's clean machine 



Penny Lane is in my ears and in my ears 

Full of fish and finger pies 

in summer meanwhile back 



Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout 

A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 

And though she feels as if she's in a play 

She is anyway 

Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer 

We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim 

And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain 

very strange 



Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 

Wet beneath the blue suburban skies 

I sit and meanwhile back 

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 

There beneath the blue suburban skies

By The Time I Get To Phoenix -- Campbell Glen
****************************************



By the time I get to Phoenix he'll be rising
He'll find the note I left hangin' on his door
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that man so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be workin'
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But he'll just here that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma He'll be sleepin'
He'll turn softly and call my name out low
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him
Though time and time I've tried to tell him so
Oh, he just didn't know
I would really go
I would really go

What else should I be

All apologies

Everyone is gay

What else could I write

I don't have the right

What else should I be

All apologies

In the sun

I wish I was like you

Easily amused

Find my nest of salt

Everything is my fault

I'll take all the blame

Aqur scafoam shame

Sunburn with freezeburn

Choking on the ashes of her enemy

All in all we all are

Stagger Lee -- Price Lloyd
****************************************



The night was clear, and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumblin' down. . .
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark.
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark.
It was Stagger Lee and Billy,
Two men who gambled late.
Stagger lee threw a seven,
Billy swore that he threw eight.
"Stagger Lee," said Billy,
"I can't let you go with that.
"You have won all my money,
"And my brand-new Stetson hat."
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44.
He said, "I'm goin' to the ballroom
"Just to pay that debt I owe."
(bridge)
Go, Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee went to the ballroom
And he strolled across the ballroom floor.
He said "You did me wrong, Billy."
And he pulled his .44.
"Stagger Lee," said Billy,
"Oh, please don't take my life!
"I've got three hungry children,
"And a very sickly wife."
Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so hard
That a bullet went through Billy
And broke the bartender's bar.
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee!
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee!

Got to not talk dirty, baby, if you want to impress me
Can't be to flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy - maybe you could be mine

Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

Women, not girls, rule my world - I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
U don't have 2 watch Dynasty 2 have an attitude
U just leave it all up 2 me - my love will be your food

U don't have 2 be rich 2 be my girl
U don't have 2 be cool 2 rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with

Respect Yourself -- The Staple Singers

If you disrespect anybody that you run in to

How in the world do you think anybody's s'posed to respect you

If you don't give a heck 'bout the man with the bible in his hand

Just get out the way, and let the gentleman do his thing

You the kind of gentleman that want everything your way

Take the sheet off your face, boy, it's a brand new day



Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you don't respect yourself

Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na

Respect yourself, respect yourself



If you're walking 'round think'n that the world owes you something cause

You're here you goin' out the world backwards like you did when you

Put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution

Oh, you cuss around women and you don't even know their names and you

Dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol man

Rain, I don't mind 

Shine, the weather's fine 



I can show you 

that when it starts to rain 

everything's the same 

I can show you 

I can show you 



Rain, I don't mind 

Shine, the weather's fine 



Can you hear me 

that when it rains and shines 

it's just a state of mind 

Can you hear me

Standing in the Shadows of Love -- The Four Tops

I'd run but there's no where to go

'Cause heartaches will follow me I know

Without your love, the love I need

It's the beginning of the end for me



'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin' 

When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving

Now wait a minute



Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?

Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?

So don't you leave me



Standin' in the shadow of love

I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come

Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love

Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come



All alone I'll desperately be

With misery my only company

Come today, in fact come tomorrow

Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow

Don't your conscience bother you

How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you

Now hold a minute



Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?

When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?

(Standing in the shadows of love

Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)

I've tried not to cry out loud

No gal you ain't gonna help me now

What did I do to cause all this grief

Now what'd I say to make you want to leave

Now wait a minute

I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?

Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?

I'm Standing in the shadows of love

I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come

Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love

Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

Standing in the shadows of.........

Surrender -- Cheap Trick
****************************************



Mother told me, yes, she told me I'd meet girls like you.

She also told me, "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch."

Just the other day I heard a soldier falling off some Indonesian junk that's going round.



Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird.

Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay.



Father says, "Your mother's right, she's really up on things."

"Before we married, Mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines."

Now, I had heard the WACS recruited old maids for the war.

But mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years.



Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird.

Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay.



Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?

Ev'ry time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?

When I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch.

Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, got my Kiss records out.



Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird.

Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay.



Away.

Away.

Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun 'n' games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees

Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, that's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get them for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
I'm gonna watch you bleed

When you're high you never ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down

You know where you are, you're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die, in the jungle
Welcome to the jungle, watch it bring you to your knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It gonna bring you down-HA

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology

Ain't got time to make no apology

Soul radiation in the dead of night

Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike me blind

Somebody gotta save my soul

Baby penerate my mind

And I'm the world's forgotten boy

And honey I'm the world's forgotten boyt

It's Too Late -- Carole King
****************************************



Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time

There's something wrong here, there can be no denying

One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying



And it's too late, baby, now it's too late

Though we really did try to make it

Something inside has died and I can't hide

And I just can't fake it



It used to be so easy living here with you

You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do

Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool



And it's too late, baby, now it's too late

Though we really did try to make it

Something inside has died and I can't hide

And I just can't fake it



There'll be good times again for me and you

But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too

Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you



But it's too late, baby, it's too late

Though we really did try to make it

Something inside has died and I can't hide

And I just can't fake it

Free Man in Paris -- Joni Mitchell
****************************************



&amp;quot;the way I see it,&amp;quot; he said 
&amp;quot;you just can't win it... 
Everybody's in it for their own gain 
You can't please 'em all 
There's always somebody calling you down 
I do my best 
And I do good business 
There's a lot of people asking for my time 
They're trying to get ahead 
They're trying to be a good friend of mine 
 
I was a free man in paris 
I felt unfettered and alive 
There was nobody calling me up for favors 
And no one's future to decide 
You know I'd go back there tomorrow 
But for the work I've taken on 
Stoking the star maker machinery 
Behind the popular song 
 
I deal in dreamers 
And telephone screamers 
Lately I wonder what I do it for 
If l had my way 
I'd just walk through those doors 
And wander 
Down the champs elysees 
Going cafe to cabaret 
Thinking how I'll feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine 
 
I was a free man in paris 
I felt unfettered and alive 
Nobody was calling me up for favors 
No one's future to decide 
You know I'd go back there tomorrow 
But for the work I've taken on 
Stoking the star maker machinery 
Behind the popular song.&amp;quot;

We're the best of friends

Insisting that the world be turnin' our way

And our way

Where Did Our Love Go -- Diana Ross
****************************************



When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes 

THE SUPREMES



He gave me the eye

But I just passed him by

I treated him unkind

But he didn't seem to mind



I told him be on his way

But not a word did he say

He just stood there kind of bold

While I acted cold



But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes

Made me realize I should apologize

And when he placed a kiss upon my face

Then I knew, Oh then I knew

That he won my heart



So I quickly apologized

Hoping he hadn't changed his mind

But not a word did he say

So I turned to walk away



But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes

Made me realize how he felt inside

And when he placed a kiss upon my face

Then I knew, Oh then I knew

That he won my heart



When he asked could he walk my way

I hoped sweet things he'd say

Instead he smiled kind of nice

As he held my hand kind of tight



But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes

Made me realize how he felt inside

And when he placed a kiss upon my face

Then I knew, Oh then I knew

That he won my heart



But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes

Made me realize how he felt inside

And when he placed a kiss upon my face

I Want To Know What Love Is -- Foreigner
****************************************



I gotta take a little time

A little time to think things over

I better read between the lines

In case I need it when I'm older



Now this mountain I must climb

Feels like a world upon my shoulders

I through the clouds I see love shine

It keeps me warm as life grows colder



In my life there's been heartache and pain

I don't know if I can face it again

Can't stop now, I've travelled so far

To change this lonely life



I wanna know what love is

I want you to show me

I wanna feel what love is

I know you can show me



I'm gonna take a little time

A little time to look around me

I've got nowhere left to hide

It looks like love has finally found me



In my life there's been heartache and pain

I don't know if I can face it again

I can't stop now, I've travelled so far

To change this lonely life



I wanna know what love is

I want you to show me

I wanna feel what love is

I know you can show me



I wanna know what love is

I want you to show me

And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is

And I know, I know you can show me



Let's talk about love

I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside

I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love

I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide

I know you can show me, yeah



I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love

I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too

I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too

And I know and I know, I know you can show me

Show me love is real, yeah

I wanna know what love is...

Super Freak
She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow girl
She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room it's the right time
She's never hard to please
{Refrain}
That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In new-wave magazine
That girl is pretty kinky

Super freak, super freak
She's a very special girl
The kind of girl you want to know
>From her head down to her toenails
Down to her feet, yeah
And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
Going back in Chinatown
Three's not a crowd to her, she says
"Room 714, I'll be waiting"
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene
{Refrain}
{Bridge}
Temptations sing!
Ohhhhh

White Rabbit -- Jefferson Airplane
****************************************



One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small

And the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all



Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall



And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall

Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call



And call Alice, when she was just small



When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go

And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low



Go ask Alice, I think she'll know



When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead

And the white knight is talking backwards

And the red queen's off with her head

Remember what the dormouse said

Feed your head, feed your head

Living his brave life of lies 

But when he turns off to sleep

All memories keep More, More, More

We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
And the bonnie boat was won
That we sailed into the mystic

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Oh, let your soul and spirit fly, into the mystic

When that fog horn blows
You know I will be comin' home
When that fog horn blows
I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

I want to rock your gypsy soul
Mama, just like way back in the days of old
And together we will float, into the mystic

Oh-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

Whoa-oh-ooh
Whoa, whoa-ooh

When that fog horn blows
You know I will be comin' home
When that fog horn blows
I wanna hear it
Well, I don't have to fear it

I want to rock your gypsy soul
So like we're back in the days of old
And unanimously we will float
Into, into, into, into the mystic

Baby, baby, baby, baby

Oh, let your body go
Oh, let your mind go on

Ho!

Spoken:
I just wanna rock
Still wanna rock your soul, baby
I just wanna rock

Just wanna rock!
Your jellyroll soul

Said I wanna rock!
Jellyroll soul
Let your body go

Yeah, I wanna rock your soul, baby
I just wanna rock your soul, baby

Mama!

Ho!

Oh yeah

Thank you.

Young Americans -- David Bowie
****************************************



They pulled in just behind the bridge

He lays her down, he frowns

"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"

He kissed her then and there

She took his ring, took his babies

It took him minutes, took her nowhere

Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but



CHORUS (SHE)

  All night

  She wants the young American

  Young American, young American, she wants the young American

  All right

  She wants the young American



Scanning life through the picture window

She finds the slinky vagabond

He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but

Heaven forbid, she'll take anything

But the freak, and his type, all for nothing

He misses a step and cuts his hand, but

Showing nothing, he swoops like a song

She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"



CHORUS (SHE)



All the way from Washington

Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor

"We live for just these twenty years

Do we have to die for the fifty more?"



CHORUS (HE)

  All night

  He wants the young American

  Young American, young American, he wants the young American

  All right

  He wants the young American



Do you remember, your President Nixon?

Do you remember, the bills you have to pay

Or even yesterday?



Have you have been an un-American?

Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout

Leather, leather everywhere, and

Not a myth left from the ghetto

Well, well, well, would you carry a razor

In case, just in case of depression?

Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors

Blushing at all the afro-Sheeners

Ain't that close to love?

Well, ain't that poster love?

Well, it ain't that Barbie doll

Her heart's been broken just like you have



CHORUS (YOU)

  All night

  You want the young American

  Young American, young American, you want the young American

  All right

  You want the young American



You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler

A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler

Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train

Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache

  (I heard the news today, oh boy)

I got a suite and you got defeat

Ain't there a man you can say no more? 

And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?

And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?

Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?

Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?

Ain't there one damn song that can make me

break down and cry?



CHORUS (I)  (repeat 3 times ad lib)

  All night

  I want the young American

  Young American, young American, I want the young American

  All right

  I want the young American

"Show me how you do that trick

The one that makes me scream" she said

"The one that makes me laugh" she said

And threw her arms around my neck

"Show me how you do it

And I promise you I promise that

I'll run away with you

I'll run away with you"



Spinning on that dizzy edge

I kissed her face and kissed her head

And dreamed of all the different ways I had

To make her glow

"Why are you so far away?" she said

"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you

That I'm in love with you"



You

Soft and only

You

Lost and lonely

You

Strange as angels

Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water

You're just like a dream



Daylight licked me into shape

I must have been asleep for days

And moving lips to breathe her name

I opened up my eyes

And found myself alone alone

Alone above a raging sea

That stole the only girl I loved

And drowned her deep inside of me



You

Soft and only

You

Lost and lonely

You

Just like heaven

Graceland -- Paul Simon
****************************************



The mississippi delta was shining 
Like a national guitar 
I am following the river 
Down the highway 
Through the cradle of the civil war 
I'm going to graceland 
Graceland 
In memphis tennessee 
I'm going to graceland 
Poorboys and pilgrims with families 
And we are going to graceland 
My traveling companion is nine years old 
He is the child of my first marriage 
But I've reason to believe 
We both will be received 
In graceland 
 
She comes back to tell me she's gone 
As if I didn't know that 
As if I didn't know my own bed 
As if I'd never noticed 
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead 
And she said losing love 
Is like a window in your heart 
Everybody sees you're blown apart 
Everybody sees the wind blow 
 
I'm going to graceland 
Memphis tennessee 
I'm going to graceland 
Poorboys and pilgrims with families 
And we are going to graceland 
 
And my traveling companions 
Are ghosts and empty sockets 
I'm looking at ghosts and empties 
But I've reason to believe 
We all will be received 
In graceland 
 
There is a girl in new york city 
Who calls herself the human trampoline 
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying 
Or tumbling in turmoil I say 
Oh, so this is what she means 
She means we're bouncing into graceland 
And I see losing love 
Is like a window in your heart 
Everybody sees you're blown apart 
Everybody sees the wind blow 
 
In graceland, in graceland 
I'm going to graceland 
For reasons I cannot explain 
There's some part of me wants to see 
Graceland 
And I may be obliged to defend 
Every love, every ending 
Or maybe there's no obligations now 
Maybe I've a reason to believe 
We all will be received 
In graceland

How Soon Is Now? -- The Smiths
****************************************



I am the son 

And the heir 

Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar 

I am the son and the heir 

Of nothing in particular 



You shut your mouth 

How can you say 

I go about things the wrong way 

I am Human and I need to be loved 

Just like everybody else does 



There's a club, if you like to go 

You could meet somebody who really loves you 

So you go, and you stand on your own 

And you leave on your own 

And you go home 

And you cry 

And you want to die 



When you say it's gonna happen "now", 

Well, when exactly do you mean? 

See I've already waited too long 

And all my hope is gone..

Rhiannon -- Fleetwood Mac
****************************************



Rhiannon rings like a bell thru the night

And wouldn't you love to love her

She rules her life like a bird in flight

And who will be her lover...





All your life you've never seen

A woman--taken by the wind

Would you stay if she promised you heaven

Will you ever win...





She is like a cat in the dark

And then she is the darkness

She rules her life like a fine skylark--

And when the sky is starless--





All your life you've never seen--

A woman--taken by the wind

Would you stay if she promised you heaven

Will you ever win...





Dreams unwind.

Love's a state of mind.



Lyrics - version from The Dance CD (live)



Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night

and wouldn't you love to love her?

She rules her life like a bird in flight

and who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen

a woman taken by the sky.

Well would you stay if she promised to you heaven?

Would you even try?

And he says, "Rhiannon, Don't go."

And he says, "Rhiannon, stay."

And he says, "I still cry out for you.

Don't leave me, don't leave me."





Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night.

And wouldn't you love to love her?

She rules her life like a bird in flight.

And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen

a woman taken by the sky.

Well would you stay if she promised to you heaven?

Would you even try?





She is like a cat in the dark,

then baby, she is your darkness.

She rules her life like a fine skylark,

when the sky is starless.

Once in a million years a lady like her rises.

Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone

Your life knows no answer, Your life knows no answer.





Rhiannon....(4*) 



She rings like a bell through the night.

And wouldn't you love to love her?

She rules her life like a bird in flight.

And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen

a woman taken by the sky.

Well would you stay if she promised to you heaven?

Would you even try? Say, would you even try?





Rhiannon....(3*) 



Dreams unwind

Love's a state of mind

Your dreams unwind

Love's a state of mind

Your dreams unwind

And still it's hard to find, I know.

Your dreams unwind

And still it's a state of mind, I know

Dreams unwind

And still it's hard to find, I know

Dreams unwind

And still it's a state of mind, I know





Take me like the wind, child

Take me with the sky

Take me now

Take me like the wind, baby

Take me with the sky

All the same

All the same

All the same, Rhiannon

All the same

Baby, all the same

All the same





And he still cries out for her,

"Don't leave me now."

I Will Survive -- Gloria Gaynor
****************************************



At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side;
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
('cause) you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Did I crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no, not.I. I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive;
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give and I'll survive,
I will survive. Hey hey.
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
And so you feel like droppin' in
And just expect me to be free,
Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
Go on now

When I said I needed you

You said you would always stay

It wasn't me who changed but you

And now you've gone away

 

Don't you see

That now you've gone

And I'm left here on my own

That I have to follow you

And beg you to come home?

 

You don't have to say you love me

Just be close at hand

You don't have to stay forever

I will understand

Believe me, believe me

I can't help but love you

But believe me

I'll never tie you down

 

Left alone with just a memory

Life seems dead and so unreal

All that's left is loneliness

There's nothing left to feel

 

You don't have to say you love me

Just be close at hand

You don't have to stay forever

I will understand

Believe me, believe me

  

You don't have to say you love me

Just be close at hand

You don't have to stay forever

I will understand

Running on Empty -- Jackson Browne
****************************************



Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels 
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields 
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-o-one 
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on 
 
Running on - running on empty 
Running on - running blind 
Running on - running into the sun 
But I'm running behind 
 
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive 
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive 
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own 
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on 
 
Running on - running on empty 
Running on - running blind 
Running on - running into the sun 
But I'm running behind 
 
Everyone I know, everywhere I go 
People need some reason to believe 
I don't know about anyone but me 
If it takes all night, that'll be all right 
If I can get you to smile before I leave 
 
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels 
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels 
I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through 
Looking into their eyes I see them running too 
 
Running on - running on empty 
Running on - running blind 
Running on - running into the sun 
But I'm running behind 
 
Honey you really tempt me 
You know the way you look so kind 
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind 
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find 
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Then He Kissed Me -- The Crystals
****************************************



Well, he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to dance.

He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance.

When he danced he held me tight

And when he walked me home that night

All the stars were shining bright

And then he kissed me.

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again.

I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend.

I didn't know just what to do

So I whispered I love you

And he said that he loved me too

And then he kissed me.

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before,

He kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forever more.

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had

And one day he took me home to meet his mon and his dad.

Then he asked me to be his bride

And always be right by his side.

I felt so happy I almost cried

And then he kissed me.

Then he asked me to be his bride

And always be right by his side.

I felt so happy I almost cried

And then he kissed me.

And then he kissed me.

And then he kissed me

Desperado -- The Eagles
****************************************



Desperado why don't you come to your senses? 

You been out ridin' fences for so long now 

Oh you're a hard one 

I know that you got your reasons 

These things that are pleasin' you 

Can hurt you somehow 



Don' you draw the queen of diamonds boy 

She'll beat you if she's able 

You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet 



Now it seems to me some fine things 

Have been laid upon your table 

But you only want the ones that you can't get 



Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no youger 

Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home 

And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin' 

Your prison is walking through this world all alone 



Don't your feet get cold in the winter time? 

The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine 

It's hard to tell the night time from the day 

You're loosin' all your highs and lows 

Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away? 



Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? 

Come down from your fences, open the gate 

It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you 

You better let somebody love you, before it's too late

Miss You -- Rolling Stones
****************************************



I've been holding out so long 
I've been sleeping all alone 
Lord I miss you 
I've been hanging on the phone 
I've been sleeping all alone 
I want to kiss you 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep 
You've been starring in my dreams 
Lord I miss you 
I've been waiting in the hall 
Been waiting on your call 
When the phone rings 
It's just some friends of mine that say, 
"Hey, what's the matter man? 
We're gonna come around at twelve 
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you. 
We're gonna bring a case of wine 
Hey, let's go mess and fool around 
You know, like we used to" 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Oh everybody waits so long 
Oh baby why you wait so long 
Won't you come on! Come on! 
I've been walking in Central Park 
Singing after dark 
People think I'm crazy 
I've been stumbling on my feet 
Shuffling through the street 
Asking people, "What's the matter with you boy?" 
Sometimes I want to say to myself 
Sometimes I say 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
I won't miss you child 
I guess I'm lying to myself 
It's just you and no one else 
Lord I won't miss you child 
You've been blotting out my mind 
Fooling on my time 
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah 
Lord, I miss you child 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Lord, I miss you child 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Lord, I miss you child 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah

Rainy Night In Georgia -- Benton Brook
****************************************



Hoverin' by my suitcase, tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain fallin', seems I hear your voice callin' "It's all right."
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs a-flashin', taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night
A rainy night in Georgia, such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game
 
I find me a place in a box car, so I take my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and
I feel fine
(minor scat) But it's a rainy night in Georgia, baby, it's a rainy night
in Georgia I
feel it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now And it's rainin'
all over the
world
Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?
And you feel that it was rainin' all over this man's world
You're talking 'bout rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin',
rainin', rainin',
rainin', rainin' rainin', rainin', rainin'

The Boys Are Back In Town -- Thin Lizzy
****************************************



Guess who just got back today?
Those wild Eyed bvoys that've been away
Haven't changed, Haven't much to say
but man i still think them cats are crazy
they were askin' if you were around
how you was where you could be found
told 'em you were livin' downtown
driving all the old men crazy

the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

You know that chick that used to dance alot?
Every night she be on the floor shakin' what She got
Man I tell ya she was cool she was red hot
I Mean she was steamin'

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know forget her

the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
I said the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

Spread the word around
guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
down at Dino's Bar &amp; Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
and if the boy's wanna fight, you'd better let 'em

the Jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song
the nights are gettin' warmer it wont be long
Wont be long till summer till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
(spread the word around) 

the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
(The boys are back, The boys are back)

The boys are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again

More Than A Feeling -- Boston
****************************************



I looked out this morning,

and the sun was gone

Turned on some music to start my day

Then lost myself in a familiar song

I closed my eyes, and I slipped away



CHORUS

It's more than a feeling

When I hear that old song the used to play

And I begin dreamin'

Till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away



So many people have come and gone

Their faces fade as the years go by 

Yet I still recall as I wander on

As clear as the sun in the summer sky



CHORUS



When I'm tired and thinkin' cold

I hide in my music, forget the day

And dream of a girl I used to know

I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away



CHORUS
